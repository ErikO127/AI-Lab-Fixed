The term spectrochemical can be broken into two different words describing what it means,
spectro- which refers to the electromagnetic spectrum, and chemical which links to atomic
chemical properties. Ligands are a part of a unique area in chemistry explaining many
phenomenons when it comes to colors that we observe and have been used by humans for a
long time stretching back as far as ancient egyptians and are still in us in today's world.
Coordination compounds are atomic compounds that are formed when a special types of bonds
are formed between the central ion and the outer ligands. The central ion is always metallic and
the outer ion can be a variety of different common non metallic molecules or atomic ions which
in a complex compound are named Ligands.
