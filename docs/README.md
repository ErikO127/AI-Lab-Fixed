This is the current documentation for the project that is being created. This project seeks to find the difference in effectiveness between two different compression algorithms. Currently the code is able to take file inputs and text strings and present a detailed and concise representation of their sizes. It presents pie chart size ratios of the text compressions to the original text, bar graphs that compare the sizes as well, and the initial text input place with raw numbers. As mentioned before the app can both take copy and paste texts and accept txt files that are drag and dropped into the app.
