The Last Leaf
In the heart of a bustling city, there stood an old brick building whose windows whispered stories of times past. On one such window was a little attic room where two aspiring artists lived and paintedâ€”Sara and John.
Sara was vibrant and full of life, her laughter a melody that filled the small space they shared. John, on the other hand, was quieter, his soul resonating with the depth of colors he stroked onto canvas. They were close friends, bound by their dreams and the art they created.
One cold autumn evening, as the wind played its melancholy tune outside, Sara caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. She noticed her pale cheeks and frail hands. "You need to rest," John insisted gently, his voice tinged with concern. Yet, she waved him off, determined not to let anything stand in the way of their upcoming exhibition.
Days turned into nights, and as autumn's grip tightened around the city, Sara's condition worsened. The vibrant colors she once painted seemed to fade from her world as a relentless fever took hold. John watched helplessly as his friend slipped further away, her spirit dimming like the waning daylight of late fall.
