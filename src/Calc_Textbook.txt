AboutCalculus Volume 1
Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to
enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand
howthoseconceptsapplytotheirlivesandtheworldaroundthem.Duetothecomprehensivenatureofthematerial,we
are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 1 covers functions, limits, derivatives, and
integration.
Coverage and scope
OurCalculus Volume 1 textbookadherestothescopeandsequenceofmostgeneralcalculuscoursesnationwide.Wehave
worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the
subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and arranged to

Introduction
In the past few years, major earthquakes have occurred in several countries around the world. In January 2010, an
earthquakeofmagnitude7.3hitHaiti.Amagnitude9earthquakeshooknortheasternJapaninMarch2011.InApril2014,
an 8.2-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of northern Chile. What do these numbers mean? In particular, how
does a magnitude 9 earthquake compare with an earthquake of magnitude 8.2? Or 7.3? Later in this chapter, we show
howlogarithmicfunctionsareusedtocomparetherelativeintensityoftwoearthquakesbasedonthemagnitudeofeach
earthquake (seeExample 1.39).
Calculus is the mathematics that describes changes in functions. In this chapter, we review all the functions necessary
tostudycalculus.Wedefinepolynomial,rational,trigonometric,exponential,andlogarithmicfunctions.Wereviewhow

Afunction f consistsofasetofinputs,asetofoutputs,andaruleforassigningeachinputtoexactlyoneoutput.The
set of inputs is called thedomain of the function. The set of outputs is called therange of the function.

A function can be visualized as an input/output
Figure 1.3 A function maps every element in the domain to
exactly one element in the range. Although each input can be
sent to only one output, two different inputs can be sent to the

Figure 1.5 Here we see a graph of the function f with
domain {1, 2, 3} and rule f (x) = 3 − x. The graph consists
of the points (x, f (x)) for all x in the domain.

Solution
a. Consider f (x) = (x− 4)2 + 5.
i. Since f (x) = (x− 4)2 + 5 is a real number for any real number x, the domain of f is the
interval (−∞, ∞).
ii. Since (x− 4)2 ≥ 0, weknow f (x) = (x− 4)2 + 5 ≥ 5. Therefore,therangemustbeasubset

given y inthatset,thereisarealnumber x suchthat f (x) = (x− 4)2 + 5 = y. Solvingthis
equation for x, we see that we need x such that
(x− 4)2

This equation is satisfied as long as there exists a real number x such that
x− 4 = ± y− 5.
Since y ≥ 5, thesquarerootiswell-defined.Weconcludethatfor x = 4 ± y− 5, f (x) = y,
and therefore the range is⎧

b. Consider f (x) = 3x + 2 − 1.
i. To find the domain of f, we need the expression 3x + 2 ≥ 0. Solving this inequality, we
conclude that the domain is {x|x ≥ −2/3}.
ii. Tofindtherangeof f, wenotethatsince 3x + 2 ≥ 0, f (x) = 3x + 2 − 1 ≥ −1. Therefore,

Solving this equation for x, we see that x must solve the equation
3x + 2 = y + 1.
Since y ≥ −1, such an x could exist. Squaring both sides of this equation, we have

Rule: Vertical Line Test
Givenafunction f, everyverticallinethatmaybedrawnintersectsthegraphof f nomorethanonce.Ifanyvertical

We can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a function (Figure 1.8).

a function because every vertical line intersects the set of points,
at most, once. (b) The set of plotted points does not represent the

Since x2 + 1 ≠ 0 forallrealnumbers x, thedomainof (g ∘ f )(x) isthesetofallrealnumbers.Since

(0, 1], thereexistsarealnumber x suchthat y = 1/(x2 + 1). Solvingthisequationfor x, wesee
that x2 + 1 = 1/y, which implies that

Working with the Absolute Value Function

Solution
Sincetheabsolutevaluefunctionisdefinedforallrealnumbers,thedomainofthisfunctionis (−∞, ∞). Since
|x− 3| ≥ 0 forall x, thefunction f (x) = 2|x− 3| + 4 ≥ 4. Therefore,therangeis,atmost,theset ⎧

Wenowexaminetherelationshipbetweenslopeandtheformulaforalinearfunction.Considerthelinearfunctiongiven
by the formula f (x) = ax + b. As discussed earlier, we know the graph of a linear function is given by a line. We
can use our definition of slope to calculate the slope of this line. As shown, we can determine the slope by calculating
(y2− y1)/(x2− x1) for any points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on the line. Evaluating the function f at x = 0, we see
that (0, b) isapointonthisline.Evaluatingthisfunctionat x = 1, weseethat (1, a + b) isalsoapointonthisline.
Therefore, the slope of this line is
(a + b) − b

f (x) = mx + b

Definition
Consider a line passing through the point (x1, y1) with slope m. The equation
y− y1 = m(x− x1)
(1.4)
is thepoint-slope equation for that line.
Consider a line with slope m and y -intercept (0, b). The equation
y = mx + b
(1.5)
is an equation for that line inslope-intercept form.
Thestandard form of a line is given by the equation
ax + by = c,
where a and b are both not zero. This form is more general because it allows for a vertical line, x = k.

Behavior at Infinity
To determine the behavior of a function f as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values f (x) as the inputs,
x, become larger. For some functions, the values of f (x) approach a finite number. For example, for the function

Finding Domain and Range for Algebraic Functions
For each of the following functions, find the domain and range.
a. f (x) = 3x− 1
5x + 2
b. To find the domain of f, we need 4 – x2 ≥ 0. Or, 4 ≥ x2 Or x2 ≤ 4 , the solution to which is
– 2 ≤ x ≤ 2 . Therefore, the domain is {x|– 2 ≤ x ≤ 2}. If– 2 ≤ x ≤ 2 , then 0 ≤ 4 – x2 ≤ 4 .
Therefore, 0 ≤ 4 – x2 ≤ 2 and the range of f is ⎧
⎩ ⎨y|0 ≤ x ≤ 2⎫
⎭ ⎬
.
Solution
a. Itisnotpossibletodividebyzero,sothedomainisthesetofrealnumbers x suchthat x ≠ −2/5. To
find the range, we need to find the values y for which there exists a real number x such that
y = 3x− 1
5x + 2.
When we multiply both sides of this equation by 5x + 2, we see that x must satisfy the equation
5xy + 2y = 3x− 1.
From this equation, we can see that x must satisfy
2y + 1 = x(3 − 5y).
If y = 3/5, this equation has no solution. On the other hand, as long as y ≠ 3/5,
2y + 1
x =
3 − 5y
satisfies this equation. We can conclude that the range of f is ⎧
⎩ ⎨y|y ≠ 3/5⎫
⎭ ⎬
.
b. To find the domain of f, we need 4 − x2 ≥ 0. When we factor, we write
4 − x2
= (2 − x)(2 + x) ≥ 0. Thisinequalityholdsifandonlyifbothtermsarepositiveorbothterms
are negative. For both terms to be positive, we need to find x such that
2 − x ≥ 0 and 2 + x ≥ 0.
Thesetwoinequalitiesreduceto 2 ≥ x and x ≥ −2. Therefore,theset {x|− 2 ≤ x ≤ 2} mustbepart
of the domain. For both terms to be negative, we need
2 − x ≤ 0 and 2 + x ≥ 0.
Thesetwoinequalitiesalsoreduceto 2 ≤ x and x ≥ −2. Therearenovaluesof x thatsatisfybothof
these inequalities. Thus, we can conclude the domain of this function is {x|− 2 ≤ x ≤ 2}.
If −2 ≤ x ≤ 2, then 0 ≤ 4 − x2 ≤ 4. Therefore, 0 ≤ 4 − x2 ≤ 2, and the range of f is

functions. In the previous example, for instance, we subtracted 2 from the argument of the function y = x2 to get the
function f (x) = (x− 2)2
. This subtraction represents a shift of the function y = x2 two units to the right. A shift,
horizontallyorvertically,isatypeoftransformation of a function.Othertransformationsincludehorizontalandvertical
scalings, and reflections about the axes.

Graphs and Periods of the Trigonometric Functions
We have seen that as we travel around the unit circle, the values of the trigonometric functions repeat. We can see this
patterninthegraphsofthefunctions.Let P = (x, y) beapointontheunitcircleandlet θ bethecorrespondingangle
. Since the angle θ and θ + 2π correspond to the same point P, the values of the trigonometric functions at θ and
at θ + 2π arethesame.Consequently,thetrigonometricfunctionsareperiodic functions. Theperiodofafunction f is

Existence of an Inverse Function
We begin with an example. Given a function f and an output y = f (x), we are often interested in finding what
value or values x were mapped to y by f. For example, consider the function f (x) = x3 + 4. Since any output

y = x3 + 4, wecansolvethisequationfor x tofindthattheinputis x = y− 4
. Thisequationdefines x asafunction
of y. Denoting this function as f −1

, and writing x = f −1 (y) = y− 4
, we see that for any x in the domain of
f, f −1 ⎛ ⎝ f (x)⎞ ⎠ = f −1 ⎛ ⎝x3 + 4⎞ ⎠= x. Thus,thisnewfunction, f −1
, “undid”whattheoriginalfunction f did.Afunction
with this property is called the inverse function of the original function.
Definition
Givenafunction f withdomain D andrange R, itsinverse function (ifitexists)isthefunction f −1 withdomain
R and range D such that f −1 (y) = x if f (x) = y. In other words, for a function f and its inverse f −1
,
f −1 ⎛ ⎝ f (x)⎞ ⎠ = x for all x in D, and f ⎛ ⎝ f −1 (y)⎞ ⎠= y for all y in R.

Definition
The inverse sine function, denoted sin−1 or arcsin, and the inverse cosine function, denoted cos−1 or arccos, are
defined on the domain D = {x|− 1 ≤ x ≤ 1} as follows:

sin−1 (x) = y if and only if sin(y) = x and −
π
2 ≤ y ≤ π
2;
cos−1 (x) = y if and only if cos(y) = x and 0 ≤ y ≤ π.
(1.12)
Theinversetangentfunction,denoted tan−1 orarctan,andinversecotangentfunction,denoted cot−1 orarccot,are
defined on the domain D = {x| − ∞ < x < ∞} as follows:
tan−1 (x) = y if and only if tan(y) = x and −
π
2 < y < π
2;
cot−1 (x) = y if and only if cot(y) = x and 0 < y < π.
(1.13)
Theinversecosecantfunction,denoted csc−1 orarccsc,andinversesecantfunction,denoted sec−1 orarcsec,are
defined on the domain D = {x||x| ≥ 1} as follows:
csc−1 (x) = y if and only if csc(y) = x and −

2 ≤ y ≤ π
2, y ≠ 0;
sec−1 (x) = y if and only if sec(y) = x and 0 ≤ y ≤ π, y ≠ π/2.
(1.14)
To graph the inverse trigonometric functions, we use the graphs of the trigonometric functions restricted to the domains
defined earlier and reflect the graphs about the line y = x (Figure 1.41).
Figure 1.41 The graph of each of the inverse trigonometric functions is a reflection about the line y = x of
the corresponding restricted trigonometric function.

Similarly, for the cosine function,

c. cos−1 ⎛ ⎝cos⎛ ⎝

4
⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠
d. sin−1 ⎛ ⎝cos⎛ ⎝
2π
⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠
Solution
a. Evaluating sin−1 ⎛ ⎝− 3/2⎞ ⎠ is equivalent to finding the angle θ such that sinθ= − 3/2 and
−π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. The angle θ= −π/3 satisfies these two conditions. Therefore,
sin−1 ⎛ ⎝− 3/2⎞ ⎠ = −π/3.
b. First we use the fact that tan−1 ⎛ ⎝−1/ 3⎞ ⎠ = −π/6. Then tan(π/6) = −1/ 3. Therefore,
tan⎛ ⎝tan−1 ⎛ ⎝−1/ 3⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠= −1/ 3.
c. To evaluate cos−1 ⎛ ⎝cos(5π/4)⎞ ⎠, first use the fact that cos(5π/4) = − 2/2. Then we need to find the
angle θ suchthat cos(θ) = − 2/2 and 0 ≤ θ ≤ π. Since 3π/4 satisfiesboththeseconditions,wehave
cos⎛ ⎝cos−1 (5π/4)⎞ ⎠= cos⎛ ⎝cos−1 ⎛ ⎝− 2/2⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠= 3π/4.
d. Since cos(2π/3) = −1/2, weneedtoevaluate sin−1 (−1/2). Thatis,weneedtofindtheangle θ such
that sin(θ) = −1/2 and−π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Since−π/6 satisfiesboththeseconditions,wecanconclude
that sin−1 (cos(2π/3)) = sin−1 (−1/2) = −π/6.

Exponential Functions
Exponential functions arise in many applications. One common example ispopulation growth.
Forexample,ifapopulationstartswith P0 individualsandthengrowsatanannualrateof 2%, itspopulationafter1year
is
P(1) = P0 + 0.02P0 = P0(1 + 0.02) = P0(1.02).
Its population after 2 years is
P(2) = P(1) + 0.02P(1) = P(1)(1.02) = P0 (1.02)2
.
In general, its population after t years is
P(t) = P0 (1.02)t

which is an exponential function. More generally, any function of the form f (x) = bx

Looking at this table, it appears that (1 + 1/m)m is approaching a number between 2.7 and 2.8 as m → ∞. In fact,
(1 + 1/m)m does approach some number as m → ∞. We call thisnumber e . To six decimal places of accuracy,
e ≈ 2.718282.

Returning to our savings account example, we can conclude that if a person puts P dollars in an account at an annual

. This function may be familiar. Since functions involving
base e arise often in applications, we call the function f (x) = ex the natural exponential function. Not only is this
function interesting because of the definition of the number e, but also, as discussed next, its graph has an important
property.
Since e > 1, we know ex is increasing on (−∞, ∞). In Figure1.45, we show a graph of f (x) = ex along with a

Suppose $500 is invested in an account at an annual interest rate of r = 5.5%, compounded continuously.
a. Let t denotethenumberofyearsaftertheinitialinvestmentand A(t) denotetheamountofmoneyin

b. Find the amount of money in the account after 10 years and after 20 years.
Solution
a. If P dollars are invested in an account at an annual interest rate r, compounded continuously, then
A(t) = Pert
. Here P = $500 and r = 0.055. Therefore, A(t) = 500e0.055t

Logarithmic Functions
Usingourunderstandingofexponentialfunctions,wecandiscusstheirinverses,whicharethelogarithmicfunctions.These
comeinhandywhenweneedtoconsideranyphenomenonthatvariesoverawiderangeofvalues,suchaspHinchemistry
or decibels in sound levels.
Theexponentialfunction f (x) = bx isone-to-one,withdomain (−∞, ∞) andrange (0, ∞). Therefore,ithasaninverse
function, called the logarithmic function with base b. For any b > 0, b ≠ 1, the logarithmic function with base b,
denoted logb, has domain (0, ∞) and range (−∞, ∞), and satisfies
logb (x) = y if and only if by = x.
For example,
102 Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs
log2(8) = 3 since 23
log10 ⎛ ⎝

logb(1) = 0 since b0

102

100,
= 1 for any base b > 0.
Furthermore, since y = logb(x) and y = bx are inverse functions,
logb (bx) = x and blogb (x)
= x.
Themostcommonly usedlogarithmic functionisthefunction loge. Sincethisfunctionusesnatural e asitsbase,itis
called thenatural logarithm. Here we use the notation ln(x) or lnx to mean loge (x). For example,
ln(e) = loge (e) = 1, ln⎛ ⎝e3⎞ ⎠= loge
⎛ ⎝e3⎞ ⎠= 3, ln(1) = loge (1) = 0.
Since the functions f (x) = ex and g(x) = ln(x) are inverses of each other,
ln(ex) = x and eln x
= x,
and their graphs are symmetric about the line y = x (Figure 1.46).
Figure 1.46 The functions y = ex and y = ln(x) are
inverses of each other, so their graphs are symmetric about the
line y = x.
Atthissite(http://www.openstax.org/l/20_logscale)youcanseeanexampleofabase-10logarithmicscale.
Ingeneral,foranybase b > 0, b ≠ 1, thefunction g(x) = logb(x) issymmetricabouttheline y = x withthefunction
f (x) = bx
. Using this fact and the graphs of the exponential functions, we graph functions logb for several values of
b > 1 (Figure 1.47).

Before solving some equations involving exponential and logarithmic functions, let’s review the basic properties of
logarithms.
Rule: Properties of Logarithms
If a, b, c > 0, b ≠ 1, and r is any real number, then
1. logb (ac) = logb (a) + logb (c) (Product property)
2. logb ⎛ ⎝

c
⎞ ⎠ = logb (a) − logb (c) (Quotient property)
3. logb (ar) = rlogb (a) (Power property)

Solution
a. Applying the natural logarithm function to both sides of the equation, we have
ln5x

Using the power property of logarithms,
x ln5 = ln2.
Therefore, x = ln2/ln5.
b. Multiplying both sides of the equation by ex
, we arrive at the equation
e2x + 6 = 5ex
.
104 Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs
Rewriting this equation as
e2x
− 5ex + 6 = 0,
we can then rewrite it as a quadratic equation in ex :

Now we can solve the quadratic equation. Factoring this equation, we obtain

Therefore, the solution is x = 1/e4

Therefore,

which implies A1 /A2 = 10 or A1 = 10A2. Since A1 is 10 times the size of A2, we say that the first

KEY CONCEPTS
1.1Review of Functions
• A function is a mapping from a set of inputs to a set of outputs with exactly one output for each input.
• Ifnodomainisstatedforafunction y = f (x), thedomainisconsideredtobethesetofallrealnumbers x for
which the function is defined.
• When sketching the graph of a function f, each vertical line may intersect the graph, at most, once.
• A function may have any number of zeros, but it has, at most, oney-intercept.
• To define the composition g ∘ f, the range of f must be contained in the domain of g.
• Even functions are symmetric about the y -axis whereas odd functions are symmetric about the origin.
1.2Basic Classes of Functions
• The power function f (x) = xn is an even function if n is even and n ≠ 0, and it is an odd function if n is odd.
• Therootfunction f (x) = x1/n hasthedomain [0, ∞) if n isevenandthedomain (−∞, ∞) if n isodd.If n
is odd, then f (x) = x1/n is an odd function.
• Thedomainoftherationalfunction f (x) = p(x)/q(x), where p(x) and q(x) arepolynomialfunctions,istheset
of x such that q(x) ≠ 0.
• Functions that involve the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers are
algebraicfunctions.Allotherfunctionsaretranscendental.Trigonometric,exponential,andlogarithmicfunctions
are examples of transcendental functions.
• A polynomial function f with degree n ≥ 1 satisfies f (x) → ±∞ as x → ±∞. The sign of the output as
x → ∞ depends on the sign of the leading coefficient only and on whether n is even or odd.
• Vertical and horizontal shifts, vertical and horizontal scalings, and reflections about the x- and y -axes are
examples of transformations of functions.
1.3Trigonometric Functions
• Radian measure is defined such that the angle associated with the arc of length 1 on the unit circle has radian
measure 1. An angle with a degree measure of 180° has a radian measure of π rad.
120 Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs
• Foracuteangles θ, thevaluesofthetrigonometricfunctionsaredefinedasratiosoftwosidesofarighttriangle
in which one of the acute angles is θ.
• For a general angle θ, let (x, y) be a point on a circle of radius r corresponding to this angle θ. The
trigonometric functions can be written as ratios involving x, y, and r.
• The trigonometric functions are periodic. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant functions have period 2π. The
tangent and cotangent functions have period π.

2. Next, let’s look at the values in each of the f (x) columns and determine whether the values seem to
be approaching a single value as we move down each column. In our columns, we look at the sequence
f (a− 0.1), f (a− 0.01), f (a− 0.001)., f (a− 0.0001), and so on, and
f (a + 0.1), f (a + 0.01), f (a + 0.001), f (a + 0.0001), and so on. (Note: Although we have chosen the
x-values a ± 0.1, a ± 0.01, a ± 0.001, a ± 0.0001, andsoforth,andthesevalueswillprobablyworknearly
every time, on very rare occasions we may need to modify our choices.)

After examining the table of functional values, we can see that the y-values do not seem to approach any one
single value. It appears the limit does not exist. Before drawing this conclusion, let’s take a more systematic

One-Sided Limits
Sometimes indicating that the limit of a function fails to exist at a point does not provide us with enough information
aboutthebehaviorofthefunctionatthatparticularpoint.Toseethis,wenowrevisitthefunction g(x) = |x− 2|/(x− 2)
introducedatthebeginningofthesection(seeFigure2.12(b)).Aswepickvaluesofxcloseto2, g(x) doesnotapproach

approaches2fromtheleft, g(x) approaches−1.Mathematically,wesaythatthelimitasxapproaches2fromtheleftis−1.
Symbolically, we express this idea as
lim
x → 2− g(x) = −1.
Similarly,asx approaches2fromtheright(orfrom the positive side), g(x) approaches1.Symbolically,weexpressthis
idea as
lim
x → 2+ g(x) = 1.
We can now present an informal definition of one-sided limits.
Definition
We define two types ofone-sided limits.

infinity. Symbolically, we express this idea as
lim
h(x) = +∞.
x → 2
More generally, we defineinfinite limits as follows:
Definition
We define three types ofinfinite limits.
Infinite limits from the left: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (b, a).
i. Ifthevaluesof f (x) increasewithoutboundasthevaluesofx (where x < a) approachthenumbera,then
we say that the limit asx approachesafrom the left is positive infinity and we write
lim
x → a− f (x) = +∞.
(2.8)
ii. Ifthevaluesof f (x) decreasewithoutboundasthevaluesofx (where x < a) approachthenumbera,then
we say that the limit asx approachesafrom the left is negative infinity and we write
lim
x → a− f (x) = −∞.
(2.9)
Infinite limits from the right: Let f (x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form (a, c).
i. Ifthevaluesof f (x) increasewithoutboundasthevaluesofx (where x > a) approachthenumbera,then
we say that the limit asx approachesafrom the right is positive infinity and we write
lim
x → a+ f (x) = +∞.
(2.10)
ii. Ifthevaluesof f (x) decreasewithoutboundasthevaluesofx (where x > a) approachthenumbera,then
we say that the limit asx approachesafrom the right is negative infinity and we write
lim
x → a+ f (x) = −∞.
(2.11)
Two-sided infinite limit: Let f (x) be defined for all x ≠ a in an open interval containinga.
i. Ifthevaluesof f (x) increasewithoutboundasthevaluesofx (where x ≠ a) approachthenumbera,then
we say that the limit asx approachesais positive infinity and we write
lim
x → a f (x) = +∞.
(2.12)
ii. Ifthevaluesof f (x) decreasewithoutboundasthevaluesofx (where x ≠ a) approachthenumbera,then
we say that the limit asx approachesais negative infinity and we write
lim
x → a f (x) = −∞.
(2.13)
It is important to understand that when we write statements such as lim
x → a f (x) = +∞ or lim
x → a f (x) = −∞ we are
describing the behavior of the function, as we have just defined it. We are not asserting that a limit exists. For the
limit of a function f (x) to exist at a, it must approach a real number L as x approaches a. That said, if, for example,
lim
x → a f (x) = +∞, we always write lim
x → a f (x) = +∞ rather than lim
x → a f (x) DNE.

Let p(x) and q(x) be polynomial functions. Letabe a real number. Then,

f (x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x)
for all x ≠ a in an open interval containingaand
lim
x → a f (x) = L = lim
x → a
h(x)
whereL is a real number, then lim
x → ag(x) = L.

Applying the Squeeze Theorem
Apply the squeeze theorem to evaluate lim

Solution
Because −1 ≤ cosx ≤ 1 forallx,wehave− |x| ≤ x cosx ≤ |x|.Since lim
x → 0( − |x|) = 0 = lim
|x|, fromthe

x cosx = 0. Thegraphsof f (x) = − |x|, g(x) = x cosx, and h(x) = |x| are
shown inFigure 2.28.

Deriving the Formula for the Area of a Circle

We can estimate the area of a circle by computing the area of an inscribed regular polygon. Think of the regular
polygonasbeingmadeupofntriangles.Bytakingthelimitasthevertexangleofthesetrianglesgoestozero,youcan
obtain the area of the circle. To see this, carry out the following steps:
1. Express the heighthand the basebof the isosceles triangle inFigure 2.31in terms of θ andr.
Figure 2.31
2. Using the expressions that you obtained in step 1, express the area of the isosceles triangle in terms ofθ andr.
(Substitute (1/2)sinθ for sin(θ /2)cos(θ /2) in your expression.)

Continuity at a Point
Before we look at a formal definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point, let’s consider various
functionsthatfailtomeetourintuitivenotionofwhatitmeanstobecontinuousatapoint.Wethencreatealistofconditions
that prevent such failures.
Our first function of interest is shown in Figure2.32. We see that the graph of f (x) has a hole at a. In fact, f (a) is
undefined. At the very least, for f (x) to be continuous ata, we need the following condition:
i. f (a) is defined.

Now we put our list of conditions together and form a definition of continuity at a point.
Definition
A function f (x) iscontinuous at a point aif and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:
i. f (a) is defined
ii. lim
x → a f (x) exists
iii. lim
x → a f (x) = f (a)
A function isdiscontinuous at a point aif it fails to be continuous ata.
The following procedure can be used to analyze the continuity of a function at a point using this definition.

Theorem 2.8:Continuity of Polynomials and Rational Functions
Polynomials and rational functions are continuous at every point in their domains.

Previously, we showed that if p(x) and q(x) are polynomials, lim
x → ap(x) = p(a) for every polynomial p(x) and

lim

q(x)
= p(a)

Types of Discontinuities
As we have seen in Example 2.26 and Example 2.27, discontinuities take on several different appearances. We
classify the types of discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump
discontinuities. Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump
discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite
discontinuity isadiscontinuity located atavertical asymptote. Figure2.37illustrates thedifferences inthesetypesof
discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities, keep in
mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories.
Figure 2.37 Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite.
These three discontinuities are formally defined as follows:
Definition
If f (x) is discontinuous ata, then
1. f hasaremovable discontinuity ata if lim
x → a f (x) exists.(Note:Whenwestatethat lim
x → a f (x) exists,we
mean that lim
x → a f (x) = L, whereL is a real number.)
2. f hasajump discontinuity ata if lim
x → a− f (x) and lim
x → a+ f (x) bothexist,but lim
x → a− f (x) ≠ lim
x → a+ f (x).
(Note:Whenwestatethat lim

neither take on the values ±∞.)
3. f has aninfinite discontinuity ataif lim

Classifying a Discontinuity
In Example 2.26, we showed that f (x) = x2
− 4
x− 2 is discontinuous at x = 2. Classify this discontinuity as
removable, jump, or infinite.

To classify the discontinuity at 2 we must evaluate lim

x− 2
(x− 2)(x + 2)

Sincef is discontinuous at 2 and lim
x → 2 f (x) exists,f has a removable discontinuity at x = 2.

In Example 2.27, we showed that f (x) =

Solution
Earlier, we showed that f is discontinuous at 3 because lim
x → 3 f (x) does not exist. However, since
lim
x → 3− f (x) = −5 and lim
x → 3+ f (x) = 4 both exist, we conclude that the function has a jump discontinuity at 3.

Continuity on an Interval
State the interval(s) over which the function f (x) = x− 1
x2 + 2x
is continuous.
Solution
Since f (x) = x− 1
is a rational function, it is continuous at every point in its domain. The domain of
x2 + 2x
f (x) is the set (−∞, −2) ∪ (−2, 0) ∪ (0, +∞). Thus, f (x) is continuous over each of the intervals

The Composite Function Theorem allows us to expand our ability to compute limits. In particular, this theorem
ultimately allows us to demonstrate that trigonometric functions are continuous over their domains.
Theorem 2.9:Composite Function Theorem
If f (x) is continuous atL and lim
x → ag(x) = L, then
lim

As we continue our study of calculus, we revisit this theorem many times.
The Intermediate Value Theorem
Functions that are continuous over intervals of the form ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦, where a and b are real numbers, exhibit many useful
properties.Throughoutourstudyofcalculus,wewillencountermanypowerfultheoremsconcerningsuchfunctions.The
first of these theorems is theIntermediate Value Theorem.
Theorem 2.11:The Intermediate Value Theorem
Letfbecontinuousoveraclosed,boundedinterval ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦. Ifzisanyrealnumberbetween f (a) and f (b), thenthere
is a numberc in ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦ satisfying f (c) = z inFigure 2.38.

Chapter 2 | Limits 189
Figure 2.38 There is a number c ∈ ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦ that satisfies
f (c) = z.
Example 2.36
Application of the Intermediate Value Theorem
Show that f (x) = x− cosx has at least one zero.
Solution
Since f (x) = x− cosx iscontinuousover (−∞, +∞), itiscontinuousoveranyclosedintervaloftheform
⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦. If you can find an interval ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦ such that f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, you can use the
IntermediateValueTheoremtoconcludetheremustbearealnumberc in (a, b) thatsatisfies f (c) = 0. Note
that

and

UsingtheIntermediateValueTheorem,wecanseethattheremustbearealnumberc in [0, π/2] thatsatisfies

Example 2.37
When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?
If f (x) is continuous over [0, 2], f (0) > 0 and f (2) > 0, can we use the Intermediate Value Theorem to
conclude that f (x) has no zeros in the interval ⎡ ⎣0, 2]? Explain.
190 Chapter 2 | Limits
Solution
No. The Intermediate Value Theorem only allows us to conclude that we can find a value between f (0) and
f (2); it doesn’t allow us to conclude that we can’t find other values. To see this more clearly, consider the
function f (x) = (x− 1)2
. It satisfies f (0) = 1 > 0, f (2) = 1 > 0, and f (1) = 0.
Example 2.38
When Can You Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem?
For f (x) = 1/x, f (−1) = −1 < 0 and f (1) = 1 > 0. Can we conclude that f (x) has a zero in the interval
[−1, 1]?
Solution
No. The function is not continuous over [−1, 1]. The Intermediate Value Theorem does not apply here.

Quantifying Closeness
Beforestatingtheformaldefinitionofalimit,wemustintroduceafewpreliminaryideas.Recallthatthedistancebetween
two pointsaandbon a number line is given by |a− b|.
• The statement | f (x) − L| < ε may be interpreted as:The distance between f (x) and L is less than ε.
• The statement 0 < |x− a| < δ may be interpreted as: x ≠ a and the distance between x and a is less than δ.
It is also important to look at the following equivalences for absolute value:
• The statement | f (x) − L| < ε is equivalent to the statement L− ε < f (x) < L + ε.
• The statement 0 < |x− a| < δ is equivalent to the statement a− δ < x < a + δ and x ≠ a.
With these clarifications, we can state the formalepsilon-delta definition of the limit.
Definition
Let f (x) be defined for all x ≠ a over an open interval containinga. LetL be a real number. Then
lim
x → a f (x) = L
if, for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0, such that if 0 < |x− a| < δ, then | f (x) − L| < ε.
This definition may seem rather complex from a mathematical point of view, but it becomes easier to understand if we

existential quantifier (thereexistsa δ > 0), and,last,aconditional statement (if 0 < |x− a| < δ, then | f (x) − L| < ε).
Let’s take a look atTable 2.9, which breaks down the definition and translates each part.

Webeginbytacklingtheproblemfromanalgebraicpointofview.Sinceultimatelywewant |(2x + 1) − 3| < ε,
we begin by manipulating this expression: |(2x + 1) − 3| < ε is equivalent to |2x− 2| < ε, which in turn
is equivalent to |2||x− 1| < ε. Last, this is equivalent to |x− 1| < ε/2. Thus, it would seem that δ= ε/2 is
appropriate.
We may also find δ through geometric methods.Figure 2.40demonstrates how this is done.
Figure 2.40 This graph shows how we find δ geometrically.
Assume 0 < |x− 1| < δ. When δ has been chosen, our goal is to show that if 0 < |x− 1| < δ, then
|(2x + 1) − 3| < ε. To prove any statement of the form “If this, then that,” we begin by assuming “this” and
trying to get “that.”
Thus,
|(2x + 1) − 3|= |2x− 2| = |2(x− 1)|
= |2||x− 1| |2|= 2

Therefore, lim
x → 1(2x + 1) = 3. (Having completed the proof, we state what we have accomplished.)
After removing all the remarks, here is a final version of the proof:
Let ε > 0.
Choose δ= ε/2.
Assume 0 < |x− 1| < δ.
Thus,
|(2x + 1) − 3|= |2x− 2|

Let ε > 0.
Choose δ=
_______.
Assume 0 < |x− (−1)| < δ. (or equivalently, 0 < |x + 1| < δ.)
Thus, |(4x + 1) − (−3)|= |4x + 4|= |4||x + 1| < 4δ
_______
ε.
Focusing on the final line of the proof, we see that we should choose δ= ε
4.
We now complete the final write-up of the proof:
Let ε > 0.
Choose δ= ε
4.
Assume 0 < |x− (−1)| < δ (or equivalently, 0 < |x + 1| < δ.)
Thus, |(4x + 1) − (−3)|= |4x + 4|= |4||x + 1| < 4δ= 4(ε/4) = ε.

In Example 2.39and Example 2.40, the proofs were fairly straightforward, since the functions with which we were
working were linear. InExample 2.41, we see how to modify the proof to accommodate a nonlinear function.

3. Choose δ= min⎧

⎭ ⎬. Figure 2.41shows how we made this choice of δ.
Figure 2.41 for the proof inExample 2.41.
This graph shows how we find δ geometrically for a given ε
4. We must show: If 0 < |x− 2| < δ, then |x2
− 4| < ε, so we must begin by assuming
0 < |x− 2| < δ.
We don’t really need 0 < |x− 2| (in other words, x ≠ 2) for this proof. Since
0 < |x− 2| < δ ⇒ |x− 2| < δ, it is okay to drop 0 < |x− 2|.
|x− 2| < δ.
Hence,
−δ < x− 2 < δ.
Recall that δ= min⎧
⎩ ⎨2 − 4 − ε, 4 + ε− 2⎫
⎭ ⎬. Thus, δ ≤ 2 − 4 − ε and consequently
−⎛ ⎝2 − 4 − ε⎞ ⎠ ≤ − δ. We also use δ ≤ 4 + ε− 2 here. We might ask at this point: Why did we
substitute 2 − 4 − ε for δ on the left-hand side of the inequality and 4 + ε− 2 on the right-hand
sideoftheinequality?IfwelookatFigure2.41,weseethat 2 − 4 − ε correspondstothedistanceon
200 Chapter 2 | Limits
the left of 2 on thex-axis and 4 + ε− 2 corresponds to the distance on the right. Thus,
−⎛ ⎝2 − 4 − ε⎞ ⎠ ≤ − δ < x− 2 < δ ≤ 4 + ε− 2.
We simplify the expression on the left:
Then, we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
−2 + 4 − ε < x− 2 < 4 + ε− 2.
4 − ε < x < 4 + ε.
We square all parts of the inequality. It is okay to do so, since all parts of the inequality are positive:
4 − ε < x2 < 4 + ε.
We subtract 4 from all parts of the inequality:
−ε < x2
− 4 < ε.
Last,
|x2
− 4| < ε.
5. Therefore,
lim
x → 2

= 4.

Example 2.42
Proving a Statement about the Limit of a Specific Function (Algebraic Approach)
Prove that lim

⎛ ⎝x2

Solution
Let’s use our outline from the Problem-Solving Strategy:
1. Let ε > 0.
2. Choose δ= min{1, ε/5}. This choice of δ may appear odd at first glance, but it was obtained by

Chapter 2 | Limits 201
taking a look at our ultimate desired inequality: |⎛ ⎝x2
− 2x + 3⎞ ⎠− 6| < ε. This inequality is equivalent
to |x + 1|· |x− 3| < ε. At this point, the temptation simply to choose δ= ε
x− 3 is very strong.
Unfortunately,ourchoiceof δ mustdependonεonlyandnoothervariable.Ifwecanreplace |x− 3| by

Thechoiceof δ ≤ 1 hereisarbitrary.Wecouldhavejustaseasilyusedanyotherpositivenumber.In
someproofs,greatercareinthischoicemaybenecessary.Now,since δ ≤ 1 and |x + 1| < δ ≤ 1, we
areabletoshowthat |x− 3| < 5. Consequently, |x + 1|· |x− 3| < |x + 1|· 5. Atthispointwerealize
that we also need δ ≤ ε/5. Thus, we choose δ= min{1, ε/5}.
3. Assume 0 < |x + 1| < δ. Thus,
|x + 1| < 1 and |x + 1| < ε
5.
Since |x + 1| < 1, wemayconcludethat −1 < x + 1 < 1. Thus,bysubtracting4fromallpartsofthe
inequality, we obtain −5 < x− 3 < −1. Consequently, |x− 3| < 5. This gives us
|⎛ ⎝x2
− 2x + 3⎞ ⎠− 6|= |x + 1|· |x− 3| < ε
5
· 5 = ε.
Therefore,
lim
x → −1
⎛ ⎝x2
− 2x + 3⎞ ⎠= 6.
2.29
Complete the proof that lim
x → 1
x2
= 1.
Let ε > 0; choose δ= min{1, ε/3}; assume 0 < |x− 1| < δ.
Since |x− 1| < 1, we may conclude that −1 < x− 1 < 1. Thus, 1 < x + 1 < 3. Hence, |x + 1| < 3.

pursuing a formal definition of infinite limits. To have lim
x → a f (x) = +∞, we want the values of the function f (x)
to get larger and larger as x approaches a. Instead of the requirement that | f (x) − L| < ε for arbitrarily small ε when
0 < |x− a| < δ forsmallenough δ, wewant f (x) > M forarbitrarilylargepositiveMwhen 0 < |x− a| < δ forsmall
enough δ. Figure 2.43illustrates this idea by showing the value of δ for successively larger values ofM.

if for every M > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x− a| < δ, then f (x) > M.

Nowthatwehavebothaconceptualunderstandingofalimitandthepracticalabilitytocomputelimits,wehaveestablished
the foundation for our study of calculus, the branch of mathematics in which we compute derivatives and integrals.
Most mathematicians and historians agree that calculus was developed independently by the Englishman Isaac Newton
(1643–1727) and the German Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), whose images appear in Figure 3.2. When we credit
NewtonandLeibniz withdevelopingcalculus, wearereallyreferringtothefactthatNewtonandLeibniz werethefirst

predecessors,suchasBarrow,Fermat,andCavalieri.Theinitialrelationshipbetweenthetwomathematiciansappearsto

Tangent Lines
Webeginourstudyofcalculusbyrevisitingthenotionofsecantlinesandtangentlines.Recallthatweusedtheslopeof

form of a difference quotient:
msec = f (x) − f (a)
x− a.
We can also calculate the slope of a secant line to a function at a value a by using this equation and replacing x with
a + h, where h is a value close to 0. We can then calculate the slope of the line through the points (a, f (a)) and
(a + h, f (a + h)). In this case, we find the secant line has a slope given by the following difference quotient with
increment h:
msec = f (a + h) − f (a)
a + h− a
= f (a + h) − f (a)
h.
Definition
Let f be a function defined on an interval I containing a. If x ≠ a is in I, then
Q= f (x) − f (a)
x− a
(3.1)
is adifference quotient.
Also, if h ≠ 0 is chosen so that a + h is in I, then
Q= f (a + h) − f (a)
h
(3.2)
is a difference quotient with increment h.

Finding a Tangent Line

Next,findapointonthetangentline.Sincethelineistangenttothegraphof f (x) at x = 3, itpassesthrough
the point ⎛ ⎝3, f (3)⎞ ⎠. We have f (3) = 9, so the tangent line passes through the point (3, 9).
Using the point-slope equation of the line with the slope m = 6 and the point (3, 9), we obtain the line
y− 9 = 6(x− 3). Simplifying, we have y = 6x− 9. The graph of f (x) = x2 and its tangent line at 3 are
shown inFigure 3.6.

Rate of Change of Temperature
A homeowner sets the thermostat so that the temperature in the house begins to drop from 70°F at 9 p.m.,
reaches a low of 60° during the night, and rises back to 70° by 7 a.m. the next morning. Suppose that the
temperatureinthehouseisgivenby T(t) = 0.4t2
− 4t + 70 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 10, where t isthenumberofhours
past 9 p.m. Find the instantaneous rate of change of the temperature at midnight.

Example 3.10
Rate of Change of Profit
A toy company can sell x electronic gaming systems at a price of p = −0.01x + 400 dollars per gaming
system.Thecostofmanufacturing x systemsisgivenby C(x) = 100x + 10,000 dollars.Findtherateofchange
of profit when 10,000 games are produced. Should the toy company increase or decrease production?
Solution
Theprofit P(x) earnedbyproducing x gamingsystemsis R(x) − C(x), where R(x) istherevenueobtained
from the sale of x games. Since the company can sell x games at p = −0.01x + 400 per game,
R(x) = xp = x(−0.01x + 400) = −0.01x2 + 400x.
Consequently,
P(x) = −0.01x2 + 300x− 10,000.
Therefore, evaluating the rate of change of profit gives
P′ (10000) = lim
x → 10000
= lim
x → 10000
P(x) − P(10000)

−0.01x2 + 300x− 2000000
= lim
x → 10000
= 100.
x− 10000
Since the rate of change of profit P′ (10,000) > 0 and P(10,000) > 0, the company should increase
production.

Graphing a Derivative
We have already discussed how to graph a function, so given the equation of a function or the equation of a derivative
function, we could graph it. Given both, we would expect to see a correspondence between the graphs of these two
functions, since f′(x) gives the rate of change of a function f (x) (or slope of the tangent line to f (x)).
InExample3.11wefoundthatfor f (x) = x, f′(x) = 1/2 x. Ifwegraphthesefunctionsonthesameaxes,asinFigure
3.12, we can use the graphs to understand the relationship between these two functions. First, we notice that f (x) is
increasingoveritsentiredomain,whichmeansthattheslopesofitstangentlinesatallpointsarepositive.Consequently,
weexpect f′ (x) > 0 forallvaluesof x initsdomain.Furthermore,as x increases,theslopesofthetangentlinesto f (x)

however,afunctionthatiscontinuousatapointneednotbedifferentiableatthatpoint.Infact,afunctionmaybecontinuous
at a point and fail to be differentiable at the point for one of several reasons.
Theorem 3.1:Differentiability Implies Continuity
Let f (x) be a function and a be in its domain. If f (x) is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a.
Proof
If f (x) is differentiable at a, then f′(a) exists and
f′ (a) = lim
x → a
f (x) − f (a)
x− a.
We want to show that f (x) is continuous at a by showing that lim
x → a f (x) = f (a). Thus,
lim
x → a f (x) = lim
⎛ ⎝ f (x) − f (a) + f (a)⎞ ⎠
x → a
= lim
x → a
⎛ ⎝
f (x) − f (a)
x− a· (x− a) + f (a)⎞ ⎠ = ⎛ ⎝ lim
f (x) − f (a)
x → a
x− a
⎞ ⎠· ⎛ ⎝ lim
x → a(x− a)⎞ ⎠ + lim
x → a f (a)
= f′(a) · 0 + f (a)
= f (a).
Therefore, since f (a) is defined and lim
x → a f (x) = f (a), we conclude that f is continuous at a.
Multiply and divide f (x) − f (a) by x− a.
□
We have just proven that differentiability implies continuity, but now we consider whether continuity implies
differentiability.Todetermineananswertothisquestion,weexaminethefunction f (x) = |x|. Thisfunctioniscontinuous
everywhere; however, f′(0) is undefined. This observation leads us to believe that continuity does not imply
differentiability. Let’s explore further. For f (x) = |x|,
f (x) − f (0)
|x| − |0|
|x|
f′ (0) = lim
x → 0

SeeFigure 3.14.
238 Chapter 3 | Derivatives
Figure 3.14 The function f (x) = |x| is continuous at 0 but
is not differentiable at 0.

Thus f′ (0) does not exist. A quick look at the graph of f (x) = x
3 clarifies the situation. The function has a vertical
tangent line at 0 (Figure 3.15).

while similar, is more complicated. In this section, we develop rules for finding derivatives that allow us to bypass this

The Basic Rules
Thefunctions f (x) = c and g(x) = xn where n isapositiveintegerarethebuildingblocksfromwhichallpolynomials
andrationalfunctionsareconstructed.Tofindderivativesofpolynomialsandrationalfunctionsefficientlywithoutresorting
to the limit definition of the derivative, we must first develop formulas for differentiating these basic functions.
The Constant Rule
We first apply the limit definition of the derivative to find the derivative of the constant function, f (x) = c. For this
function, both f (x) = c and f (x + h) = c, so we obtain the following result:
f (x + h) − f (x)
f′ (x) = lim
h → 0

Theorem 3.2:The Constant Rule

Notice that the first term in the expansion of

other terms contain powers of h that are two or
greater.
In this step the x3 terms have been cancelled,
leaving only terms containing h.

, thepoweron
x becomes the coefficient of x2 in the derivative and the power on x in the derivative decreases by 1. The following
theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of x. We will eventually extend this result to
negativeintegerpowers.Later,wewillseethatthisrulemayalsobeextendedfirsttorationalpowersof x andthento
arbitrary powers of x. Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to functions in which a constant is raised to a
variable power, such as f (x) = 3x
.
Theorem 3.3:The Power Rule
Let n be a positive integer. If f (x) = xn
, then
f′ (x) = nxn− 1
.
Alternatively, we may express this rule as
d

For f (x) = xn where n is a positive integer, we have
Since (x + h)n

The Product Rule
Now that we have examined the basic rules, we can begin looking at some of the more advanced rules. The first one
examines the derivative of the product of two functions. Although it might be tempting to assume that the derivative of

Theorem 3.5:Product Rule
Let f (x) and g(x) be differentiable functions. Then
d
⎛ ⎝ f (x)g(x)⎞ ⎠ = d
⎛ ⎝ f (x)⎞ ⎠· g(x) + d
⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠· f (x).
dx
dx
dx
That is,
if j(x) = f (x)g(x), then j′ (x) = f′ (x)g(x) + g′ (x) f (x).
This means that the derivative of a product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second
function plus the derivative of the second function times the first function.
Proof
We begin by assuming that f (x) and g(x) are differentiable functions. At a key point in this proof we need to use the
fact that, since g(x) is differentiable, it is also continuous. In particular, we use the fact that since g(x) is continuous,
lim
h → 0g(x + h) = g(x).
254 Chapter 3 | Derivatives
h.
By applying the limit definition of the derivative to j(x) = f (x)g(x), we obtain
f (x + h)g(x + h) − f (x)g(x)
j′ (x) = lim
h → 0
By adding and subtracting f (x)g(x + h) in the numerator, we have
j′ (x) = lim
h → 0
f (x + h)g(x + h) − f (x)g(x + h) + f (x)g(x + h) − f (x)g(x)
h.
After breaking apart this quotient and applying the sum law for limits, the derivative becomes
j′ (x) = lim
h → 0
⎛ ⎝
f (x + h)g(x + h) − f (x)g(x + h)
⎞ ⎠ + lim
h → 0
⎛ ⎝

⎞ ⎠.

Rearranging, we obtain

⎛ ⎝

Byusingthecontinuityof g(x), thedefinitionofthederivativesof f (x) and g(x), andapplyingthelimitlaws,wearrive
at the product rule,
j′ (x) = f′ (x)g(x) + g′ (x) f (x).

Example 3.23
Applying the Product Rule to Functions at a Point
For j(x) = f (x)g(x), use the product rule to find j′(2) if f (2) = 3, f′ (2) = −4, g(2) = 1, and g′ (2) = 6.
Solution
Since j(x) = f (x)g(x), j′ (x) = f′ (x)g(x) + g′ (x) f (x), and hence
j′ (2) = f′ (2)g(2) + g′ (2) f (2) = (−4)(1) + (6)(3) = 14.

j′ (x) = f′ (x)g(x) + g′ (x) f (x) = (2x)⎛ ⎝3x3

We can think of the function k(x) as the product of the function f (x)g(x) and the function h(x). That is,
k(x) = ⎛ ⎝ f (x)g(x)⎞ ⎠· h(x). Thus,

Amount of Change Formula
One application for derivatives is to estimate an unknown value of a function at a point by using a known value of a
functionatsomegivenpointtogetherwithitsrateofchangeatthegivenpoint.If f (x) isafunctiondefinedonaninterval
⎡ ⎣a, a + h⎤ ⎦, thentheamount of change of f (x) overtheintervalisthechangeinthe y valuesofthefunctionoverthat
interval and is given by
f (a + h) − f (a).
Theaverage rate of change ofthefunction f overthatsameintervalistheratiooftheamountofchangeoverthatinterval
to the corresponding change in the x values. It is given by
f (a + h) − f (a)
h.
As we already know, the instantaneous rate of change of f (x) at a is its derivative
f (a + h) − f (a)
f′ (a) = lim
h → 0
h.
For small enough values of h, f′ (a) ≈ f (a + h) − f (a)
h. We can then solve for formula:
f (a + h) to get the amount of change
f (a + h) ≈ f (a) + f′(a)h.

Figure 3.22 The new value of a changed quantity equals the
original value plus the rate of change times the interval of
change: f (a + h) ≈ f (a) + f′ (a)h.
Here is an interestingdemonstration (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_chainrule)of rate of change.
Example 3.33
Estimating the Value of a Function
If f (3) = 2 and f′ (3) = 5, estimate f (3.2).
Solution
Begin by finding h. We have h= 3.2 − 3 = 0.2. Thus,
f (3.2) = f (3 + 0.2) ≈ f (3) + (0.2) f′ (3) = 2 + 0.2(5) = 3.

Definition
Let s(t) be a function giving the position of an object at time t.
The velocity of the object at time t is given by v(t) = s′ (t).
The speed of the object at time t is given by |v(t)|.
The acceleration of the object at t is given by a(t) = v′ (t) = s″(t).

Example 3.34
Comparing Instantaneous Velocity and Average Velocity
A ball is dropped from a height of 64 feet. Its height above ground (in feet) t seconds later is given by
s(t) = −16t2 + 64.
a. b. What is the instantaneous velocity of the ball when it hits the ground?
What is the average velocity during its fall?
Solution
Thefirstthingtodoisdeterminehowlongittakestheballtoreachtheground.Todothis,set s(t) = 0. Solving
−16t2 + 64 = 0, we get t = 2, so it take 2 seconds for the ball to reach the ground.
a. Theinstantaneousvelocityoftheballasitstrikesthegroundis v(2). Since v(t) = s′ (t) = −32t, we
obtain v(t) = −64 ft/s.

a. Is the particle moving from left to right or from right to left at time t = 1?
b. Is the particle speeding up or slowing down at time t = 1?
Solution
Begin by finding v(t) and a(t).

Chapter 3 | Derivatives 269
v(t) = s′ (t) = 3t2
- 4 and a(t) = v′ (t) = s″(t) = 6t.
Evaluating these functions at t = 1, we obtain v(1) = −1 and a(1) = 6.
a. Because v(1) < 0, the particle is moving from right to left.
b. Because v(1) < 0 and a(1) > 0, velocity andacceleration areactinginoppositedirections. Inother
words, the particle is being accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is traveling,
causing |v(t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing down.
Example 3.36
Position and Velocity
The position of a particle moving along a coordinate axis is given by s(t) = t3
− 9t2 + 24t + 4, t ≥ 0.
a. Find v(t).
b. c. d. At what time(s) is the particle at rest?
On what time intervals is the particle moving from left to right? From right to left?
Use the information obtained to sketch the path of the particle along a coordinate axis.
Solution
a. The velocity is the derivative of the position function:
v(t) = s′ (t) = 3t2
− 18t + 24.
b. The particle is at rest when v(t) = 0, so set 3t2
− 18t + 24 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side of the
equation produces 3(t− 2)(t− 4) = 0. Solving, we find that the particle is at rest at t = 2 and t = 4.

Population Change
In addition to analyzing velocity, speed, acceleration, and position, we can use derivatives to analyze various types of
populations, including those as diverse as bacteria colonies and cities. We can use a current population, together with a
growthrate,toestimatethesizeofapopulationinthefuture.Thepopulationgrowthrateistherateofchangeofapopulation
and consequently can be represented by the derivative of the size of the population.
Definition
If P(t) is the number of entities present in a population, then the population growth rate of P(t) is defined to be
P′ (t).
Example 3.37
Estimating a Population
Thepopulationofacityistriplingevery5years.Ifitscurrentpopulationis10,000,whatwillbeitsapproximate
population 2 years from now?
Solution
Let P(t) bethepopulation(inthousands) t yearsfromnow.Thus,weknowthat P(0) = 10 andbasedonthe
information, we anticipate P(5) = 30. Now estimate P′ (0), the current growth rate, using
P′ (0) ≈
P(5) − P(0)
5 − 0
= 30 − 10
5
= 4.
By applyingEquation 3.10to P(t), we can estimate the population 2 years from now by writing
P(2) ≈ P(0) + (2)P′ (0) ≈ 10 + 2(4) = 18;
thus, in 2 years the population will be 18,000.

Changes in Cost and Revenue
In addition to analyzing motion along a line and population growth, derivatives are useful in analyzing changes in cost,
revenue,andprofit.Theconceptofamarginalfunctioniscommoninthefieldsofbusinessandeconomicsandimpliesthe
useofderivatives.Themarginalcostisthederivativeofthecostfunction.Themarginalrevenueisthederivativeofthe
revenuefunction.Themarginalprofitisthederivativeoftheprofitfunction,whichisbasedonthecostfunctionandthe
revenue function.
Definition
If C(x) is the cost of producingx items, then themarginal cost MC(x) is MC(x) = C′ (x).
If R(x) is the revenue obtained from selling x items, then the marginal revenue MR(x) is MR(x) = R′ (x).
If P(x) = R(x) − C(x) istheprofitobtainedfromsellingx items,thenthemarginal profit MP(x) isdefinedtobe
MP(x) = P′ (x) = MR(x) − MC(x) = R′ (x) − C′ (x).
We can roughly approximate
MC(x) = C′ (x) = lim
h → 0
C(x + h) − C(x)
h
by choosing an appropriate value for h. Since x represents objects, a reasonable and small value for h is 1. Thus, by
substituting h= 1, we get the approximation MC(x) = C′ (x) ≈ C(x + 1) − C(x). Consequently, C′ (x) for a given
value of x can be thought of as the change in cost associated with producing one additional item. In a similar way,
MR(x) = R′ (x) approximatestherevenueobtainedbysellingoneadditionalitem,and MP(x) = P′ (x) approximatesthe
profit obtained by producing and selling one additional item.
Example 3.38
Applying Marginal Revenue
Assumethatthenumberofbarbequedinnersthatcanbesold, x, canberelatedtothepricecharged, p, bythe
equation p(x) = 9 − 0.03x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 300.
In this case, the revenue in dollars obtained by selling x barbeque dinners is given by
R(x) = xp(x) = x(9 − 0.03x) = −0.03x2 + 9x for 0 ≤ x ≤ 300.
Use the marginal revenue function to estimate the revenue obtained from selling the 101st barbeque dinner.
Compare this to the actual revenue obtained from the sale of this dinner.
Solution
First, find the marginal revenue function: MR(x) = R′ (x) = −0.06x + 9.
Next,use R′ (100) toapproximate R(101) − R(100), therevenueobtainedfromthesaleofthe101stdinner.
Since R′ (100) = 3, the revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is approximately $3.
The actual revenue obtained from the sale of the 101st dinner is
R(101) − R(100) = 602.97 − 600 = 2.97, or $2.97.
The marginal revenue is a fairly good estimate in this case and has the advantage of being easy to compute.

Solution
To determine when the particle is at rest, set s′ (t) = v(t) = 0. Begin by finding s′ (t). We obtain
s′ (t) = 2cost− 1,
so we must solve

Because we are finding an equation of a line, we need a point. The x-coordinate of the point is 2. To find the

Think of h(x) = cos(g(x)) as f ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ where f (x) = cosx. Since f′ (x) = −sinx. we have
f′ ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ = −sin⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠. Then we do the following calculation.
h′ (x) = f′ ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠g′ (x) Apply the chain rule.
= −sin⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠g′ (x) Substitute f′ ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ = −sin⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠.
Thus, the derivative of h(x) = cos⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ is given by h′ (x) = −sin⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠g′ (x).
In the following example we apply the rule that we have just derived.
Example 3.52
Using the Chain Rule on a Cosine Function
Find the derivative of h(x) = cos⎛ ⎝5x2⎞ ⎠.
Solution
Let g(x) = 5x2
. Then g′ (x) = 10x. Using the result from the previous example,
h′ (x) = −sin⎛ ⎝5x2⎞ ⎠· 10x
= −10x sin⎛ ⎝5x2⎞ ⎠.
Example 3.53
Using the Chain Rule on Another Trigonometric Function
Find the derivative of h(x) = sec⎛ ⎝4x5 + 2x⎞ ⎠.
Solution
Apply the chain rule to h(x) = sec⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ to obtain
h′ (x) = sec(g(x)tan⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠g′ (x).
In this problem, g(x) = 4x5 + 2x, so we have g′ (x) = 20x4 + 2. Therefore, we obtain
h′ (x) = sec⎛ ⎝4x5 + 2x⎞ ⎠tan⎛ ⎝4x5 + 2x⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝20x4 + 2⎞ ⎠
= (20x4 + 2)sec⎛ ⎝4x5 + 2x⎞ ⎠tan⎛ ⎝4x5 + 2x⎞ ⎠.

Composites of Three or More Functions
We can now combine the chain rule with other rules for differentiating functions, but when we are differentiating the
composition of three or more functions, we need to apply the chain rule more than once. If we look at this situation in
generalterms,wecangenerateaformula,butwedonotneedtorememberit,aswecansimplyapplythechainrulemultiple

In general terms, first we let
k(x) = h⎛ ⎝ f ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠.

Rule: Chain Rule for a Composition of Three Functions
For all values ofx for which the function is differentiable, if
k(x) = h⎛ ⎝ f ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠,
then
k′ (x) = h′ ⎛ ⎝ f ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠ f′ ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠g′ (x).
In other words, we are applying the chain rule twice.

Rewriting, we obtain

Although it is clear that

it is not obvious that
lim

= f′ ⎛ ⎝g(a)⎞ ⎠.
To see that this is true, first recall that sincegis differentiable at a, g is also continuous at a. Thus,
lim
x → ag(x) = g(a).
Next, make the substitution y = g(x) and b= g(a) and use change of variables in the limit to obtain

The Derivative of an Inverse Function
Webeginbyconsideringafunctionanditsinverse.If f (x) isbothinvertibleanddifferentiable,itseemsreasonablethat
the inverse of f (x) is also differentiable. Figure3.28shows the relationship between a function f (x) and its inverse
f −1 (x). Lookatthepoint ⎛ ⎝a, f −1 (a)⎞ ⎠ onthegraphof f −1(x) havingatangentlinewithaslopeof ⎛ ⎝ f −1⎞ ⎠′ (a) = p
q. This
pointcorrespondstoapoint ⎛ ⎝ f −1 (a), a⎞ ⎠ onthegraphof f (x) havingatangentlinewithaslopeof f′ ⎛ ⎝ f −1 (a)⎞ ⎠= q
p.
Thus, if f −1(x) is differentiable at a, then it must be the case that
⎛ ⎝ f −1⎞ ⎠′ (a) = 1
f′ ⎛ ⎝ f −1 (a)⎞ ⎠.
Figure 3.28 The tangent lines of a function and its inverse are
related; so, too, are the derivatives of these functions.
We may also derive the formula for the derivative of the inverse by first recalling that x = f ⎛ ⎝ f −1 (x)⎞ ⎠. Then by
differentiating both sides of this equation (using the chain rule on the right), we obtain
1 = f′ ⎛ ⎝ f −1 (x)⎞ ⎠⎛ ⎝ f −1 )′(x)⎞ ⎠.
Solving for ( f −1 )′(x), we obtain
⎛ ⎝ f −1⎞ ⎠′ (x) = 1
f′ ⎛ ⎝ f −1 (x)⎞ ⎠.
(3.19)
We summarize this result in the following theorem.

Functions
Learning Objectives
3.9.1 3.9.2 3.9.3 Find the derivative of exponential functions.
Find the derivative of logarithmic functions.
Use logarithmic differentiation to determine the derivative of a function.
Sofar,wehavelearnedhowtodifferentiateavarietyoffunctions,includingtrigonometric,inverse,andimplicitfunctions.
In this section, we explore derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions. As we discussed in Introduction to
Functions and Graphs, exponential functions play an important role in modeling population growth and the decay
ofradioactivematerials.Logarithmicfunctionscanhelprescalelargequantitiesandareparticularlyhelpfulforrewriting
complicated expressions.
Derivative of the Exponential Function
Just as when we found the derivatives of other functions, we can find the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic
functionsusingformulas.Aswedeveloptheseformulas,weneedtomakecertainbasicassumptions.Theproofsthatthese
assumptions hold are beyond the scope of this course.
First of all, we begin with the assumption that the function B(x) = bx
, b > 0, is defined for every real number and is
continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined—beginning
with the definition of bn
, where n is a positive integer—as the product of b multiplied by itself n times. Later,
we defined b0
= 1, b−n
= 1
bn, for a positive integer n, and bs/t
= ( b
t )s for positive integers s and t. These
definitionsleaveopenthequestionofthevalueof br where r isanarbitraryrealnumber.Byassumingthecontinuity of
B(x) = bx
, b > 0, wemayinterpret br as lim
bx wherethevaluesof x aswetakethelimitarerational.Forexample,
x → r
we may view 4π as the number satisfying
43 < 4π < 44
, 43.1 < 4π < 43.2
, 43.14 < 4π < 43.15
,
43.141 < 4π < 43.142
, 43.1415 < 4π < 43.1416
,….
As we see in the following table, 4π ≈ 77.88.

Table 3.6Approximating a Value of 4π
We also assume that for B(x) = bx
, b > 0, the value B′ (0) of the derivative exists. In this section, we show that by
making this one additional assumption, it is possible to prove that the function B(x) is differentiable everywhere.
We make one final assumption: that there is a unique value of b > 0 for which B′ (0) = 1. We define e to be this
unique value, as we did in Introduction toFunctions andGraphs. Figure 3.33provides graphs of the functions
y = 2x
, y = 3x
, y = 2.7x
, and y = 2.8x
. A visual estimate of the slopes of the tangent lines to these functions at 0

exponential function. Its inverse, L(x) = loge x = ln x is called thenatural logarithmic function.

3.6The Chain Rule
• The chain rule allows us to differentiate compositions of two or more functions. It states that for h(x) = f ⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠,

• We can use the chain rule with other rules that we have learned, and we can derive formulas for some of them.
• The chain rule combines with the power rule to form a new rule:

n− 1 g′ (x).
• When applied to the composition of three functions, the chain rule can be expressed as follows: If
h(x) = f ⎛ ⎝g⎛ ⎝k(x)⎞ ⎠⎞ ⎠, then h′ (x) = f′(g⎛ ⎝k(x)⎞ ⎠g′ ⎛ ⎝k(x)⎞ ⎠k′ (x).

4.1.1 Express changing quantities in terms of derivatives.
4.1.2 Find relationships among the derivatives in a given problem.
4.1.3 Use the chain rule to find the rate of change of one quantity that depends on the rate of
change of other quantities.
We have seen that for quantities that are changing over time, the rates at which these quantities change are given by
derivatives. If two related quantities are changing over time, the rates at which the quantities change are related. For
example,ifaballoonisbeingfilledwithair,boththeradiusoftheballoonandthevolumeoftheballoonareincreasing.

Solution

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 343
The volume of a sphere of radius r centimeters is
V= 4
3πr3 cm3
.
Since the balloon is being filled with air, both the volume and the radius are functions of time. Therefore, t
seconds after beginning to fill the balloon with air, the volume of air in the balloon is
V(t) = 4
3π[r(t)]3 cm3
.
Differentiatingbothsidesofthisequationwithrespecttotimeandapplyingthechainrule,weseethattherateof
change in the volume is related to the rate of change in the radius by the equation
V′(t) = 4π⎡ ⎣r(t)⎤ ⎦
2 r′ (t).
The balloon is being filled with air at the constant rate of 2 cm3/sec, so V′(t) = 2 cm3 /sec. Therefore,
2cm3 /sec = ⎛ ⎝4π⎡ ⎣r(t)⎤ ⎦
2 cm2⎞ ⎠· ⎛ ⎝r′(t)cm/s⎞ ⎠,
which implies
r′(t) = 1

Solution
Step 1. Draw a picture, introducing variables to represent the different quantities involved.
Figure 4.3 An airplane is flying at a constant height of 4000 ft. The distance between the
person and the airplane and the person and the place on the ground directly below the airplane
are changing. We denote those quantities with the variables s and x, respectively.
Asshown, x denotesthedistancebetweenthemanandthepositiononthegrounddirectlybelowtheairplane.
Thevariable s denotesthedistancebetweenthemanandtheplane.Notethatboth x and s arefunctionsof
time. We do not introduce a variable for the height of the plane because it remains at a constant elevation of
4000 ft. Sinceanobject’sheightabovethegroundismeasuredastheshortestdistancebetweentheobjectand

ft/sec.Sinceweareaskedtofindtherateofchangeinthedistancebetweenthemanandtheplanewhentheplane

Step 3. From the figure, we can use thePythagorean theoremto write an equation relating x and s:
⎡ ⎣x(t)⎤ ⎦
2 + 40002
= ⎡ ⎣s(t)⎤ ⎦
2
.
Step 4. Differentiating this equation with respect to time and using the fact that the derivative of a constant is
zero, we arrive at the equation

We see that

and we conclude that the hypotenuse is
c = 1000 26 ft.
Therefore, when h= 1000, we have

Figure 4.7 (a) The tangent line to f (x) = 1/x at x = 2 provides a good approximation to f for x near 2.
(b) At x = 2.1, the value of y on the tangent line to f (x) = 1/x is 0.475. The actual value of f (2.1) is

f (x) ≈ f (a) + f′(a)(x− a) for x near a.
We call the linear function
L(x) = f (a) + f′(a)(x− a)

the linear approximation, or tangent line approximation, of f at x = a. This function L is also known as the

Linear Approximation of x
Find the linear approximation of f (x) = x at x = 9 and use the approximation to estimate 9.1.
Solution
Since we are looking for the linear approximation at x = 9, approximation is given by
using Equation 4.1 we know the linear
L(x) = f (9) + f′(9)(x− 9).
We need to find f (9) and f′(9).

Using the linear approximation, we can estimate Figure 4.8 The local linear approximation to f (x) = x at

358 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
L(x) = f (0) + f′(0)(x− 0).
Because
f (x) = (1 + x)n f′(x) = n(1 + x)n− 1 ⇒ f (0) = 1
⇒ f′(0) = n,
the linear approximation is given byFigure 4.10(a).
L(x) = 1 + n(x− 0) = 1 + nx
We can approximate (1.01)3 by evaluating L(0.01) when n = 3. We conclude that
(1.01)3
= f (1.01) ≈ L(1.01) = 1 + 3(0.01) = 1.03.

For each of the following functions, finddy and evaluate when x = 3 and dx = 0.1.

b. y = cosx
Solution
The key step is calculating the derivative. When we have that, we can obtaindy directly.
a. Since f (x) = x2 + 2x, we know f′(x) = 2x + 2, and therefore
dy = (2x + 2)dx.
When x = 3 and dx = 0.1,
b. Since f (x) = cosx, f′(x) = −sin(x). This gives us
dy = (2 · 3 + 2)(0.1) = 0.8.
dy = −sinx dx.
When x = 3 and dx = 0.1,

approximation. For x near a, f (x) can be approximated by the linear approximation
L(x) = f (a) + f′(a)(x− a).
Therefore, if dx is small,
f (a + dx) ≈ L(a + dx) = f (a) + f′(a)(a + dx− a).
360 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
That is,
f (a + dx) − f (a) ≈ L(a + dx) − f (a) = f′(a)dx.
In other words, the actual change in the function f if x increases from a to a + dx is approximately the difference
between L(a + dx) and f (a), where L(x) isthelinearapproximationof f at a. Bydefinitionof L(x), thisdifference
is equal to f′(a)dx. In summary,
Δy = f (a + dx) − f (a) ≈ L(a + dx) − f (a) = f′(a)dx = dy.
Therefore, we can use the differential dy = f′(a)dx to approximate the change in y if x increases from x = a to
x = a + dx. We can see this in the following graph.
Figure 4.11 The differential dy = f′(a)dx is used to approximate the actual

Example 4.9
Approximating Change with Differentials
Let y = x2 + 2x. Compute Δy anddy at x = 3 if dx = 0.1.
Solution
The actual change in y if x changes from x = 3 to x = 3.1 is given by
Δy = f (3.1) − f (3) = [(3.1)2 + 2(3.1)] − [32 + 2(3)] = 0.81.
The approximate change in y is given by dy = f′(3)dx. Since f′(x) = 2x + 2, we have
dy = f′(3)dx = (2(3) + 2)(0.1) = 0.8.

For y = x2 + 2x, find Δy and dy at x = 3 if dx = 0.2.

Suppose the side length of a cube is measured to be 5 cm with an accuracy of 0.1 cm.
a. Use differentials to estimate the error in the computed volume of the cube.
b. Computethevolumeofthecubeifthesidelengthis(i)4.9cmand(ii)5.1cmtocomparetheestimated

Solution
a. The measurement of the side length is accurate to within ±0.1 cm. Therefore,
−0.1 ≤ dx ≤ 0.1.
The volume of a cube is given by V= x3
, which leads to
dV= 3x2 dx.
Using the measured side length of 5 cm, we can estimate that
−3(5)2(0.1) ≤ dV ≤ 3(5)2(0.1).
Therefore,
b. −7.5 ≤ dV ≤ 7.5.
If the side length is actually 4.9 cm, then the volume of the cube is

If the side length is actually 5.1 cm, then the volume of the cube is

Therefore, the actual volume of the cube is between 117.649 and 132.651. Since the side length is

4.3.4 Describe how to use critical points to locate absolute extrema over a closed interval.
Given a particular function, we are often interested in determining the largest and smallest values of the function. This
information is important in creating accurate graphs. Finding the maximum and minimum values of a function also
has practical significance because we can use this method to solve optimization problems, such as maximizing profit,
minimizingtheamountofmaterialusedinmanufacturinganaluminumcan,orfindingthemaximumheightarocketcan
reach. In this section, we look at how to use derivatives to find the largest and smallest values for a function.
Absolute Extrema
Consider the function f (x) = x2 + 1 over the interval (−∞, ∞). As x → ±∞, f (x) → ∞. Therefore, the function
does not have a largest value. However, since x2 + 1 ≥ 1 for all real numbers x and x2 + 1 = 1 when x = 0, the
functionhasasmallestvalue,1,when x = 0. Wesaythat1istheabsoluteminimumof f (x) = x2 + 1 anditoccursat
x = 0. We say that f (x) = x2 + 1 does not have an absolute maximum (see the following figure).
Figure 4.12 The given function has an absolute minimum of 1
at x = 0. The function does not have an absolute maximum.

The absolute maximum value of the function occurs at the higher peak, at x = 2. However, x = 0 is also a point of

asFermat’s theorem.
Theorem 4.2:Fermat’s Theorem
If f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c, then f′(c) = 0.
Proof
Suppose f has a local extremum at c and f is differentiable at c. We need to show that f′(c) = 0. To do this, we
willshowthat f′(c) ≥ 0 and f′(c) ≤ 0, andtherefore f′(c) = 0. Since f hasalocalextremumat c, f hasalocal
maximum or local minimum at c. Suppose f has a local maximum at c. The case in which f has a local minimum
at c can be handled similarly. There then exists an open interval I such that f (c) ≥ f (x) for all x ∈ I. Since f is
differentiable at c, from the definition of the derivative, we know that
f (x) − f (c)
f′(c) = lim
x → c

Since this limit exists, both one-sided limits also exist and equal f′(c). Therefore,

Theorem 4.3:Location of Absolute Extrema
Let f be a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval I. The absolute maximum of f over I and the
absolute minimum of f over I must occur at endpoints of I or at critical points of f in I.
With this idea in mind, let’s examine a procedure for locating absolute extrema.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Locating Absolute Extrema over a Closed Interval
Consider a continuous function f defined over the closed interval [a, b].
1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = a and x = b.
2. Find all critical points of f that lie over the interval (a, b) and evaluate f at those critical points.
3. Compareallvaluesfoundin(1)and(2).FromLocationofAbsoluteExtrema,theabsoluteextremamust
occuratendpointsorcriticalpoints.Therefore,thelargestofthesevaluesistheabsolutemaximumof f. The
smallest of these values is the absolute minimum of f.

Now let’s look at how to use this strategy to find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum values for continuous
functions.
Example 4.13

Solution
a. Step 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = 1 and x = 3.
f (1) = 0 and f (3) = −2
Step2.Since f′(x) = −2x + 3, f′ isdefinedforallrealnumbers x. Therefore,therearenocritical
points where the derivative is undefined. It remains to check where f′(x) = 0. Since
f′(x) = −2x + 3 = 0 at x = 3

the following graph.

for x ≠ 0. The derivative is zero when 2x4/3

Describe the significance of the Mean Value Theorem.
State three important consequences of the Mean Value Theorem.
TheMean Value Theorem isoneofthemostimportanttheoremsincalculus.Welookatsomeofitsimplicationsatthe
end of this section. First, let’s start with a special case of the Mean Value Theorem, called Rolle’s theorem.
Rolle’s Theorem
Informally,Rolle’s theorem statesthatiftheoutputsofadifferentiablefunction f areequalattheendpointsofaninterval,
then there must be an interior point c where f′(c) = 0. Figure 4.21illustrates this theorem.
Figure 4.21 If a differentiable functionf satisfies f (a) = f (b), between a and b.
then its derivative must be zero at some point(s)
Theorem 4.4:Rolle’s Theorem
Let f beacontinuousfunctionovertheclosedinterval [a, b] anddifferentiableovertheopeninterval (a, b) such
that f (a) = f (b). There then exists at least one c ∈ (a, b) such that f′(c) = 0.
Proof
Let k= f (a) = f (b). We consider three cases:
1. f (x) = k for all x ∈ (a, b).
2. There exists x ∈ (a, b) such that f (x) > k.
3. There exists x ∈ (a, b) such that f (x) < k.
Case 1: If f (x) = k for all x ∈ (a, b), then f′(x) = 0 for all x ∈ (a, b).
Case2:Since f isacontinuousfunctionovertheclosed,boundedinterval [a, b], bytheextremevaluetheorem,ithas
anabsolutemaximum.Also,sincethereisapoint x ∈ (a, b) suchthat f (x) > k, theabsolutemaximumisgreaterthan
k. Therefore,theabsolutemaximumdoesnotoccurateitherendpoint.Asaresult,theabsolutemaximummustoccuratan
interiorpoint c ∈ (a, b). Because f hasamaximumataninteriorpoint c, and f isdifferentiableat c, byFermat’s
theorem, f′(c) = 0.
380 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Case3:Thecasewhenthereexistsapoint x ∈ (a, b) suchthat f (x) < k isanalogoustocase2,withmaximumreplaced
by minimum.
□
AnimportantpointaboutRolle’stheoremisthatthedifferentiabilityofthefunction f iscritical.If f isnotdifferentiable,
evenatasinglepoint,theresultmaynothold.Forexample,thefunction f (x) = |x|− 1 iscontinuousover [−1, 1] and
f (−1) = 0 = f (1), but f′(c) ≠ 0 for any c ∈ (−1, 1) as shown in the following figure.
Figure 4.22 Since f (x) = |x|− 1 is not differentiable at
x = 0, the conditions of Rolle’s theorem are not satisfied. In
fact, the conclusion does not hold here; there is no c ∈ (−1, 1)
such that f′(c) = 0.
Let’s now consider functions that satisfy the conditions of Rolle’s theorem and calculate explicitly the points c where
f′(c) = 0.
Example 4.14

− 4x over [−2, 2]
Solution
a. Since f isapolynomial,itiscontinuousanddifferentiableeverywhere.Inaddition, f (−2) = 0 = f (0).
Therefore, f satisfies the criteria of Rolle’s theorem. We conclude that there exists at least one value
c ∈ (−2, 0) such that f′(c) = 0. Since f′(x) = 2x + 2 = 2(x + 1), we see that
f′(c) = 2(c + 1) = 0 implies c = −1 as shown in the following graph.

asaslantedversionofRolle’stheorem(Figure4.25).TheMeanValueTheoremstatesthatif f iscontinuousoverthe
closedinterval [a, b] anddifferentiableovertheopeninterval (a, b), thenthereexistsapoint c ∈ (a, b) suchthatthe
tangent line to the graph of f at c is parallel to the secant line connecting ⎛ ⎝a, f (a)⎞ ⎠ and ⎛ ⎝b, f (b)⎞ ⎠.
Figure 4.25 The Mean Value Theorem says that for a function
that meets its conditions, at some point the tangent line has the
same slope as the secant line between the ends. For this
function, there are two values c1 and c2 such that the tangent
line to f at c1 and c2 has the same slope as the secant line.
Theorem 4.5:Mean Value Theorem
Let f be continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b). Then, there
exists at least one point c ∈ (a, b) such that
f′(c) = f (b) − f (a)
b− a.
Proof
TheprooffollowsfromRolle’stheorembyintroducinganappropriatefunctionthatsatisfiesthecriteriaofRolle’stheorem.
Consider the line connecting ⎛ ⎝a, f (a)⎞ ⎠ and ⎛ ⎝b, f (b)⎞ ⎠. Since the slope of that line is
f (b) − f (a)
b− a
and the line passes through the point ⎛ ⎝a, f (a)⎞ ⎠, the equation of that line can be written as
y = f (b) − f (a)
b− a (x− a) + f (a).
Let g(x) denote the vertical difference between the point ⎛ ⎝x, f (x)⎞ ⎠ and the point (x, y) on that line. Therefore,
g(x) = f (x) − ⎡ ⎣
f (b) − f (a)
b− a (x− a) + f (a)⎤ ⎦.
This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.12
Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 383
Figure 4.26 The value g(x) is the vertical difference
between the point (x, f (x)) and the point (x, y) on the secant
line connecting (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)).
Since the graph of f intersects the secant line when x = a and x = b, we see that g(a) = 0 = g(b). Since f is a
differentiablefunctionover (a, b), g isalsoadifferentiablefunctionover (a, b). Furthermore,since f iscontinuous
over [a, b], g isalsocontinuousover [a, b]. Therefore, g satisfiesthecriteriaofRolle’stheorem.Consequently,there
exists a point c ∈ (a, b) such that g′(c) = 0. Since
g′(x) = f′(x) −
f (b) − f (a)
,
b− a
we see that
f (b) − f (a)
g′(c) = f′(c) −
b− a.
Since g′(c) = 0, we conclude that
f′(c) = f (b) − f (a)
b− a.

Corollaries of the Mean Value Theorem
Let’snowlookatthreecorollariesoftheMeanValueTheorem.Theseresultshaveimportantconsequences,whichweuse
in upcoming sections.
At this point, we know the derivative of any constant function is zero. The Mean Value Theorem allows us to conclude
thattheconverseisalsotrue.Inparticular,if f′ (x) = 0 forall x insomeinterval I, then f (x) isconstantoverthat
interval.Thisresultmayseemintuitivelyobvious,butithasimportantimplicationsthatarenotobvious,andwediscuss

Theorem 4.6:Corollary 1: Functions with a Derivative of Zero
Let f be differentiable over an interval I. If f′ (x) = 0 for all x ∈ I, then f (x) = constant for all x ∈ I.
Proof
Since f isdifferentiableover I, f mustbecontinuousover I. Suppose f (x) isnotconstantforall x in I. Thenthere
exist a, b ∈ I, where a ≠ b and f (a) ≠ f (b). Choose the notation so that a < b. Therefore,
f (b) − f (a)
b− a ≠ 0.
Since f is a differentiable function, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that
f′ (c) = f (b) − f (a)
b− a.
Therefore, there exists c ∈ I such that f′ (c) ≠ 0, which contradicts the assumption that f′ (x) = 0 for all x ∈ I.

FromCorollary1:FunctionswithaDerivativeofZero,itfollowsthatiftwofunctionshavethesamederivative,
they differ by, at most, a constant.
Theorem 4.7:Corollary 2: Constant Difference Theorem
If f and g aredifferentiableoveraninterval I and f′ (x) = g′ (x) forall x ∈ I, then f (x) = g(x) + C forsome
constant C.
Proof
Let h(x) = f (x) − g(x). Then, h′ (x) = f′ (x) − g′ (x) = 0 forall x ∈ I. ByCorollary1,thereisaconstant C suchthat
h(x) = C for all x ∈ I. Therefore, f (x) = g(x) + C for all x ∈ I.

Figure 4.29 If a function has a positive derivative over some interval I, then the function
increases over that interval I; if the derivative is negative over some interval I, then the
function decreases over that interval I.
Theorem 4.8:Corollary 3: Increasing and Decreasing Functions
Let f be continuous over the closed interval [a, b] and differentiable over the open interval (a, b).
i. If f′ (x) > 0 for all x ∈ (a, b), then f is an increasing function over [a, b].
ii. If f′(x) < 0 for all x ∈ (a, b), then f is a decreasing function over [a, b].
Proof
Wewillprovei.;theproofofii.issimilar.Suppose f isnotanincreasingfunctionon I. Thenthereexist a and b in I
suchthat a < b, but f (a) ≥ f (b). Since f isadifferentiablefunctionover I, bytheMeanValueTheoremthereexists
c ∈ (a, b) such that
f′ (c) = f (b) − f (a)
b− a.
Since f (a) ≥ f (b), we know that f (b) − f (a) ≤ 0. Also, a < b tells us that b− a > 0. We conclude that
f′ (c) = f (b) − f (a)
b− a
≤ 0.
However, f′ (x) > 0 for all x ∈ I. This is a contradiction, and therefore f must be an increasing function over I.

A continuous function f has a local maximum at point c if and only if f switches from increasing to decreasing at
point c. Similarly, f hasalocalminimumat c ifandonlyif f switchesfromdecreasingtoincreasingat c. If f isa
continuousfunctionoveraninterval I containing c anddifferentiableover I, exceptpossiblyat c, theonlyway f
can switch from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) at point c is if f′ changes sign as x increases through c. If
f isdifferentiableat c, theonlywaythat f′
. canchangesignas x increasesthrough c isif f′ (c) = 0. Therefore,
forafunction f thatiscontinuousoveraninterval I containing c anddifferentiableover I, exceptpossiblyat c, the
onlyway f canswitchfromincreasingtodecreasing(orviceversa)isif f′(c) = 0 or f′ (c) isundefined.Consequently,
to locate local extrema for a function f, we look for points c in the domain of f such that f′(c) = 0 or f′ (c) is
undefined. Recall that such points are called critical points of f.
Notethat f neednothavealocalextremaatacriticalpoint.Thecriticalpointsarecandidatesforlocalextremaonly.In

UsingFigure 4.31, we summarize the main results regarding local extrema.
• If a continuous function f has a local extremum, it must occur at a critical point c.
• The function has a local extremum at the critical point c if and only if the derivative f′ switches sign as x
increases through c.
• Therefore, to test whether a function has a local extremum at a critical point c, f′ (x) to the left and right of c.

Theorem 4.9:First Derivative Test
Supposethat f isacontinuousfunctionoveraninterval I containingacriticalpoint c. If f isdifferentiableover
I, except possibly at point c, then f (c) satisfies one of the following descriptions:
i. If f′ changessignfrompositivewhen x < c tonegativewhen x > c, then f (c) isalocalmaximumof f.
ii. If f′ changessignfromnegativewhen x < c topositivewhen x > c, then f (c) isalocalminimumof f.
iii. If f′ hasthesamesignfor x < c and x > c, then f (c) isneitheralocalmaximumnoralocalminimumof
f.
We can summarize the first derivative test as a strategy for locating local extrema.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Using the First Derivative Test
Consider a function f that is continuous over an interval I.
1. Find all critical points of f and divide the interval I into smaller intervals using the critical points as
endpoints.
2. Analyze the sign of f′ in each of the subintervals. If f′ is continuous over a given subinterval (which is
typicallythecase),thenthesignof f′ inthatsubintervaldoesnotchangeand,therefore,canbedetermined
bychoosinganarbitrarytestpoint x inthatsubintervalandbyevaluatingthesignof f′ atthattestpoint.Use
the sign analysis to determine whether f is increasing or decreasing over that interval.
3. UseFirstDerivativeTestandtheresultsofstep 2 todeterminewhether f hasalocalmaximum,alocal
minimum, or neither at each of the critical points.
Now let’s look at how to use this strategy to locate all local extrema for particular functions.

divide the interval (−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, −1), (−1, 0), (0, 1), and (1, ∞).

all x ∈ I (Figure4.38).Then,byCorollary 3, f′ isadecreasingfunctionover I. Since f′ (a) = 0, weconcludethat
forall x ∈ I, f′ (x) > 0 if x < a and f′ (x) < 0 if x > a. Therefore,bythefirstderivativetest, f hasalocalmaximum

increasingfunctionover I. Since f′ (b) = 0, weconcludethatforall x ∈ I, f′ (x) < 0 if x < b and f′ (x) > 0 if
x > b. Therefore, by the first derivative test, f has a local minimum at x = b.
400 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Figure 4.38 Consider a twice-differentiable function f such
that f″ is continuous. Since f′(a) = 0 and f″(a) < 0,
there is an interval I containing a such that for all x in I, f
is increasing if x < a and f is decreasing if x > a. As a
result, f has a local maximum at x = a. Since f′(b) = 0
and f″(b) > 0, there is an interval I containing b such that
for all x in I, f is decreasing if x < b and f is increasing
if x > b. As a result, f has a local minimum at x = b.
Theorem 4.11:Second Derivative Test
Suppose f′ (c) = 0, f″ is continuous over an interval containing c.
i. If f″(c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
ii. If f″(c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
iii. If f″(c) = 0, then the test is inconclusive.
Note that for case iii. when f″(c) = 0, then f may have a local maximum, local minimum, or neither at c. For
example, the functions f (x) = x3
, f (x) = x4
, and f (x) = −x4 all have critical points at x = 0. In each case, the
secondderivativeiszeroat x = 0. However,thefunction f (x) = x4 hasalocalminimumat x = 0 whereasthefunction
f (x) = −x4 has a local maximum at x, and the function f (x) = x3 does not have a local extremum at x = 0.

Infinite Limits at Infinity
Sometimes the values of a function f become arbitrarily large as x → ∞ (or as x → −∞). In this case, we write

magnitude as x → ∞ (or as x → −∞), we write lim
x → ∞ f (x) = −∞ (or lim
x → −∞ f (x) = −∞).
For example, consider the function f (x) = x3
. As seen in Table 4.3and Figure 4.47, as x → ∞ the values f (x)
become arbitrarily large. Therefore, lim
x3
x → ∞
= ∞. On the other hand, as x → −∞, the values of f (x) = x3 are
negative but become arbitrarily large in magnitude. Consequently, lim

We can summarize the results of Example 4.25to make the following conclusion regarding end behavior for rational
functions. Consider a rational function

q(x)
=

leading terms. In addition, using long division, the function can be rewritten as
f (x) = p(x)

wherethedegreeof r(x) islessthanthedegreeof q(x). Asaresult, lim

4x2 + 5 ≈ 4x2
= 2|x|
for large values of x in effect x appears just to the first power in the denominator. Therefore, we divide the
numerator and denominator by |x|. Then, using the fact that |x| = x for x > 0, |x| = −x for x < 0, and
|x| = x2 for all x, we calculate the limits as follows:

Guidelines for Drawing the Graph of a Function

showing how to graph specific functions, let’s look at a general strategy to use when graphing any function.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Drawing the Graph of a Function
Given a function f, use the following steps to sketch a graph of f :
1. Determine the domain of the function.
2. Locate the x - and y -intercepts.
3. Evaluate lim

wherethedegreeof r(x) islessthanthedegreeof q(x). Thevaluesof f (x) approachthevaluesof g(x) as
426 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
x → ±∞. If g(x) is a linear function, it is known as anoblique asymptote.
4. Determine whether f has any vertical asymptotes.
5. Calculate f′
. Find all critical points and determine the intervals where f is increasing and where f is
decreasing. Determine whether f has any local extrema.
6. Calculate f″
. Determine the intervals where f is concave up and where f is concave down. Use this
informationtodeterminewhether f hasanyinflectionpoints.Thesecondderivativecanalsobeusedasan
alternate means to determine or verify that f has a local extremum at a critical point.
Now let’s use this strategy to graph several different functions. We start by graphing a polynomial function.
Example 4.28
Sketching a Graph of a Polynomial
Sketch a graph of f (x) = (x− 1)2 (x + 2).
Solution
Step 1. Since f is a polynomial, the domain is the set of all real numbers.
Step2.When x = 0, f (x) = 2. Therefore,the y -interceptis (0, 2). Tofindthe x -intercepts,weneedtosolve
the equation (x− 1)2 (x + 2) = 0, gives us the x -intercepts (1, 0) and (−2, 0)
Step3.Weneedtoevaluatetheendbehaviorof f. As x → ∞, (x− 1)2 → ∞ and (x + 2) → ∞. Therefore,
lim
x → ∞ f (x) = ∞. As x → −∞, (x− 1)2 → ∞ and (x + 2) → −∞. Therefore, lim
x → −∞ f (x) = −∞. Toget
evenmoreinformationabouttheendbehaviorof f, wecanmultiplythefactorsof f. Whendoingso,wesee
that
f (x) = (x− 1)2 (x + 2) = x3
− 3x + 2.
Since the leading term of f is x3
, we conclude that f behaves like y = x3 as x → ±∞.
Step 4. Since f is a polynomial function, it does not have any vertical asymptotes.
Step 5. The first derivative of f is
f′ (x) = 3x2
− 3.
Therefore, f hastwocriticalpoints: x = 1, −1. Dividetheinterval (−∞, ∞) intothethreesmallerintervals:
(−∞, −1), (−1, 1), and (1, ∞). Then, choose test points x = −2, x = 0, and x = 2 from these
intervals and evaluate the sign of f′ (x) at each of these test points, as shown in the following table.

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 427
Interval Test

Sign of Derivative
f′(x)= 3x2
− 3 = 3(x− 1)(x + 1)
Conclusion
(−∞, −1) x = −2 (+)(−)(−) = + f is
increasing.
(−1, 1) x = 0 (+)(−)(+) = − f is
decreasing.
(1, ∞) x = 2 (+)(+)(+) = + f is
increasing.
From the table, we see that f has a local maximum at x = −1 and a local minimum at x = 1. Evaluating
f (x) atthosetwopoints,wefindthatthelocalmaximumvalueis f (−1) = 4 andthelocalminimumvalueis
f (1) = 0.
Step 6. The second derivative of f is
f″(x) = 6x.
The second derivative is zero at x = 0. Therefore, to determine the concavity of f, divide the interval
(−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞), and choose test points x = −1 and x = 1 to
determine the concavity of f on each of these smaller intervals as shown in the following table.
Test Point Interval Sign of f″(x)= 6x Conclusion
(−∞, 0) x = −1 − f is concave down.
(0, ∞) x = 1 + f is concave up.
We note that the information in the preceding table confirms the fact, found in step 5, that f has a local
maximumat x = −1 andalocalminimumat x = 1. Inaddition,theinformationfoundinstep 5 —namely, f
hasalocalmaximumat x = −1 andalocalminimumat x = 1, and f′ (x) = 0 atthosepoints—combined
with the fact that f″ changes sign only at x = 0 confirms the results found in step 6 on the concavity of f.
Combining this information, we arrive at the graph of f (x) = (x− 1)2 (x + 2) shown in the following graph.

Solution
Step1.Thefunction f isdefinedaslongasthedenominatorisnotzero.Therefore,thedomainisthesetofall

Step 2. Find the intercepts. If x = 0, then f (x) = 0, so 0 is an intercept. If y = 0, then x2

⎛ ⎝1 − x2⎞ ⎠
which implies x = 0. Therefore, (0, 0) is the only intercept.

Solution
Step 1. The domain of f is the set of all real numbers x except x = 1.
Step 2. Find the intercepts. We can see that when x = 0, f (x) = 0, so (0, 0) is the only intercept.
Step 3. Evaluate the limits at infinity. Since the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the

we can maximize the area of a rectangle subject to some constraint on the perimeter.
Example 4.32
Maximizing the Area of a Garden
Arectangulargardenistobeconstructedusingarockwallasonesideofthegardenandwirefencingforthe
other three sides (Figure4.62).Given 100 ft ofwire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a
garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?
Figure 4.62 We want to determine the measurements x and
y that will create a garden with a maximum area using 100 ft
of fencing.
Solution
Let x denotethelengthofthesideofthegardenperpendiculartotherockwalland y denotethelengthofthe
side parallel to the rock wall. Then the area of the garden is
A= x· y.
440 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Wewanttofindthemaximumpossibleareasubjecttotheconstraintthatthetotalfencingis 100 ft. FromFigure
4.62, the total amount of fencing used will be 2x + y. Therefore, the constraint equation is
2x + y = 100.
Solving this equation for y, we have y = 100 − 2x. Thus, we can write the area as
A(x) = x· (100 − 2x) = 100x− 2x2
.
Before trying to maximize the area function A(x) = 100x− 2x2
, we need to determine the domain under
consideration. To construct a rectangular garden, we certainly need the lengths of both sides to be positive.
Therefore,weneed x > 0 and y > 0. Since y = 100 − 2x, if y > 0, then x < 50. Therefore,wearetrying
todeterminethemaximumvalueof A(x) for x overtheopeninterval (0, 50). Wedonotknowthatafunction
necessarilyhasamaximumvalueoveranopeninterval.However,wedoknowthatacontinuousfunctionhas
an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum) over a closed interval. Therefore, let’s consider the function
A(x) = 100x− 2x2 over the closed interval ⎡ ⎣0, 50⎤ ⎦. If the maximum value occurs at an interior point, then
wehavefoundthevalue x intheopeninterval (0, 50) thatmaximizestheareaofthegarden.Therefore,we
consider the following problem:
Maximize A(x) = 100x− 2x2 over the interval ⎡ ⎣0, 50⎤ ⎦.
As mentioned earlier, since A is a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, by the extreme value
theorem,ithasamaximumandaminimum.Theseextremevaluesoccureitheratendpointsorcriticalpoints.At
theendpoints, A(x) = 0. Sincetheareaispositiveforall x intheopeninterval (0, 50), themaximummust
occur at a critical point. Differentiating the function A(x), we obtain
A′ (x) = 100 − 4x.
Therefore,theonlycriticalpointis x = 25 (Figure4.63).Weconcludethatthemaximumareamustoccurwhen
x = 25. Thenwehave y = 100 − 2x = 100 − 2(25) = 50. Tomaximizetheareaofthegarden,let x = 25 ft
and y = 50 ft. The area of this garden is 1250 ft2
.

Maximizing the Volume of a Box

corneroftheboxandfoldinguptheflapsoneachside.Whatsizesquareshouldbecutoutofeachcornertoget
a box with the maximum volume?
Solution
Step 1: Let x be the side length of the square to be removed from each corner (Figure 4.64). Then, the
remaining four flaps can be folded up to form an open-top box. Let V be the volume of the resulting box.
442 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Figure 4.64 A square with side length x inches is removed from each
corner of the piece of cardboard. The remaining flaps are folded to form an
open-top box.
Step 2: We are trying to maximize the volume of a box. Therefore, the problem is to maximize V.
Step 3: As mentioned in step 2, are trying to maximize the volume of a box. The volume of a box is
V= L· W· H, where L, W, and H are the length, width, and height, respectively.
Step4:FromFigure4.64,weseethattheheightoftheboxis x inches,thelengthis 36 − 2x inches,andthe
width is 24 − 2x inches. Therefore, the volume of the box is
V(x) = (36 − 2x)(24 − 2x)x = 4x3
− 120x2 + 864x.
Step 5: To determine the domain of consideration, let’s examine Figure 4.64. Certainly, we need x > 0.
Furthermore,thesidelengthofthesquarecannotbegreaterthanorequaltohalfthelengthoftheshorterside, 24
in.;otherwise,oneoftheflapswouldbecompletelycutoff.Therefore,wearetryingtodeterminewhetherthere
isamaximumvolumeoftheboxfor x overtheopeninterval (0, 12). Since V isacontinuousfunctionover
theclosedinterval [0, 12], weknow V willhaveanabsolutemaximumovertheclosedinterval.Therefore,
weconsider V overtheclosedinterval [0, 12] andcheckwhethertheabsolutemaximumoccursataninterior
point.
Step6:Since V(x) isacontinuousfunctionovertheclosed,boundedinterval [0, 12], V musthaveanabsolute
maximum (and an absolute minimum). Since V(x) = 0 at the endpoints and V(x) > 0 for 0 < x < 12, the
maximum must occur at a critical point. The derivative is
V′ (x) = 12x2
To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation
12x2
− 240x + 864 = 0.
Dividing both sides of this equation by 12, the problem simplifies to solving the equation
x2
− 20x + 72 = 0.
Using the quadratic formula, we find that the critical points are

Since 10 + 2 7 isnotinthedomainofconsideration,theonlycriticalpointweneedtoconsideris 10 − 2 7.
Therefore, the volume is maximized if we let x = 10 − 2 7 in. The maximum volume is

= y2
, and we obtain
y = (6 − x)2 + 4. Thus, the total time spent traveling is given by the function
T(x) = x

Therefore,
Squaring both sides of this equation, we see that if 3 (6 − x)2 + 4 = 8(6 − x).
x satisfies this equation, then x must satisfy

Therefore, the possibilities for critical points are

Example 4.35
Maximizing Revenue
Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge customers p dollars per day to rent a
car, where 50 ≤ p ≤ 200, the number of cars n they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function
446 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
n(p) = 1000 − 5p. Iftheycharge $50 perdayorless,theywillrentalltheircars.Iftheycharge $200 per
dayormore,theywillnotrentanycars.Assumingtheownersplantochargecustomersbetween$50perdayand
$200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?
Solution
Step1:Let p bethepricechargedpercarperdayandlet n bethenumberofcarsrentedperday.Let R bethe
revenue per day.
Step 2: The problem is to maximize R.
Step3:Therevenue(perday)isequaltothenumberofcarsrentedperdaytimesthepricechargedpercarper
day—that is, R = n × p.
Step 4: Since the number of cars rented per day is modeled by the linear function n(p) = 1000 − 5p, revenue R can be represented by the function
the
R(p) = n × p = ⎛ ⎝1000 − 5p⎞ ⎠ p = −5p2 + 1000p.
Step5:Sincetheownersplantochargebetween $50 percarperdayand $200 percarperday,theproblemis
to find the maximum revenue R(p) for p in the closed interval ⎡ ⎣50, 200⎤ ⎦.
Step 6: Since R is a continuous function over the closed, bounded interval ⎡ ⎣50, 200⎤ ⎦, it has an absolute
maximum (and an absolute minimum) in that interval. To find the maximum value, look for critical points.
The derivative is R′ (p) = −10p + 1000. Therefore, the critical point is p = 100 When p = 100,
R(100) = $50,000. When p = 50, R(p) = $37,500. When p = 200, R(p) = $0. Therefore,theabsolute
maximum occurs at p = $100. The car rental company should charge $100 per day per car to maximize
revenue as shown in the following figure.
Figure 4.67 To maximize revenue, a car rental company has to
balance the price of a rental against the number of cars people
will rent at that price.

occurs at an interior point, then we have found an absolute maximum in the open interval.
Step6:Asmentionedearlier, A(x) isacontinuousfunctionovertheclosed,boundedinterval [0, 2]. Therefore,
it has an absolute maximum (and absolute minimum). At the endpoints x = 0 and x = 2, A(x) = 0. For
0 < x < 2, A(x) > 0. Therefore,themaximummustoccuratacriticalpoint.Takingthederivativeof A(x),

Minimizing Surface Area
Arectangularboxwithasquarebase,anopentop,andavolumeof 216 in.3 istobeconstructed.Whatshould
the dimensions of the box be to minimize the surface area of the box? What is the minimum surface area?
Solution
Step1:Drawarectangularboxandintroducethevariable x torepresentthelengthofeachsideofthesquare
base; let y represent the height of the box. Let S denote the surface area of the open-top box.
Figure 4.69 We want to minimize the surface area of a
square-based box with a given volume.
Step 2: We need to minimize the surface area. Therefore, we need to minimize S.
Step3:Sincetheboxhasanopentop,weneedonlydeterminetheareaofthefourverticalsidesandthebase.
Theareaofeachofthefourverticalsidesis x· y. Theareaofthebaseis x2
. Therefore,thesurfaceareaofthe
box is
S= 4xy + x2
.
Step 4: Since the volume of this box is x2 y and the volume is given as 216 in.
3
, the constraint equation is
x2 y = 216.
Solvingtheconstraintequationfor y, wehave y = 216
x2. Therefore,wecanwritethesurfaceareaasafunction
of x only:
S(x) = 4x⎛ ⎝
216
x2
⎞ ⎠ + x2
.
Therefore, S(x) = 864
x + x2
.
Step 5: Since we are requiring that x2 y = 216, we cannot have x = 0. Therefore, we need x > 0. On the
other hand, x is allowed to have any positive value. Note that as x becomes large, the height of the box
y becomes correspondingly small so that x2 y = 216. Similarly, as x becomes small, the height of the box
becomescorrespondinglylarge.Weconcludethatthedomainistheopen,unboundedinterval (0, ∞). Notethat,
unlike the previous examples, we cannot reduce our problem to looking for an absolute maximum or absolute

This is considered an indeterminate form because we cannot determine the exact behavior of f (x)

x → a f (x) = lim
x → ag(x), then the ratio f (x)/g(x) is
approximately equal to the ratio of their linear approximations near a.
f′ (x)(x− a)
Since f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a, and therefore f (a) = lim
x → a f (x) = 0. Similarly,
g(a) = lim
x → ag(x) = 0. If we also assume that f′ and g′ are continuous at x = a, then f′ (a) = lim
x → a f′ (x) and
g′ (a) = lim

−∞, or the limit is one-sided.
Example 4.39
Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule (∞/∞ Case)
Evaluate each of the following limits by applying L’Hôpital’s rule.

b. lim

Solution
a. Since 3x + 5 and 2x + 1 are first-degree polynomials with positive leading coefficients,
lim
x → ∞(3x + 5) = ∞ and lim
x → ∞(2x + 1) = ∞. Therefore, we apply L’Hôpital’s rule and obtain
3x + 5
lim
x → ∞
2x + 1 / x

Note that this limit can also be calculated without invoking L’Hôpital’s rule. Earlier in the chapter we

L’Hôpital’s rule provides us with an alternative means of evaluating this type of limit.

Indeterminate Form of Type ∞ − ∞
Another type of indeterminate form is ∞ − ∞. Consider the following example. Let n be a positive integer and let
f (x) = 3xn and g(x) = 3x2 + 5. As x → ∞, f (x) → ∞ and g(x) → ∞. We are interested in lim
⎛ ⎝ f (x) − g(x)⎞ ⎠.

Dependingonwhether f (x) growsfaster, g(x) growsfaster,ortheygrowatthesamerate,asweseenext,anythingcan

⎛ ⎝3x3

Therefore,thelimitcannotbedeterminedbyconsideringonly ∞ − ∞. Nextweseehowtorewriteanexpressioninvolving

= (tanx) − x2
x2 tanx.
As x → 0+
, the numerator tanx− x2 → 0 and the denominator x2 tanx → 0. Therefore, we can apply
L’Hôpital’s rule. Taking the derivatives of the numerator and the denominator, we have
lim

(tanx) − x2

x → 0+
⎛ ⎝sec2 x⎞ ⎠− 2x

As x → 0+
,
⎛ ⎝sec2 x⎞ ⎠− 2x → 1 and x2 sec2 x + 2x tanx → 0. Since the denominator is positive as x
approaches zero from the right, we conclude that
lim
x → 0+
⎛ ⎝sec2 x⎞ ⎠− 2x
x2 sec2 x + 2x tanx

Therefore,

Growth Rates of Functions
Suppose the functions f and g both approach infinity as x → ∞. Although the values of both functions become
arbitrarily large as the values of x become sufficiently large, sometimes one function is growing more quickly than the
other. For example, f (x) = x2 and g(x) = x3 both approach infinity as x → ∞. However, as shown in the following
table, the values of x3 are growing much faster than the values of x2
.

of tangent line approximations and is behind the method used often by calculators and computers to find zeroes.
Describing Newton’s Method
Consider the task of finding the solutions of f (x) = 0. If f is the first-degree polynomial f (x) = ax + b, then the
b
solution of f (x) = 0 is given by the formula x = −
a. If f is the second-degree polynomial f (x) = ax2 + bx + c,
thesolutionsof f (x) = 0 canbefoundbyusingthequadraticformula.However,forpolynomialsofdegree 3 ormore,
findingrootsof f becomesmorecomplicated.Althoughformulasexistforthird-andfourth-degreepolynomials,theyare
quitecomplicated.Also,if f isapolynomialofdegree 5 orgreater,itisknownthatnosuchformulasexist.Forexample,
consider the function
f (x) = x5 + 8x4 + 4x3
− 2x− 7.
Noformulaexiststhatallowsustofindthesolutionsof f (x) = 0. Similardifficultiesexistfornonpolynomialfunctions.
Forexample,considerthetaskoffindingsolutionsof tan(x) − x = 0. Nosimpleformulaexistsforthesolutionsofthis
equation. In cases such as these, we can use Newton’s method to approximate the roots.
Newton’s method makes use of the following idea to approximate the solutions of f (x) = 0. By sketching a graph of
f, we can estimate a root of f (x) = 0. Let’s call this estimate x0. We then draw the tangent line to f at x0. If
f′ (x0) ≠ 0, thistangentlineintersectsthe x -axisatsomepoint ⎛ ⎝x1, 0⎞ ⎠. Nowlet x1 bethenextapproximationtothe

Nowlet’slookathowtocalculatetheapproximations x0, x1, x2 ,…. If x0 isourfirstapproximation,theapproximation
x1 isdefinedbyletting ⎛ ⎝x1, 0⎞ ⎠ bethe x -interceptofthetangentlineto f at x0. Theequationofthistangentlineisgiven
by
y = f (x0) + f′ (x0)(x− x0).
Therefore, x1 must satisfy
f (x0) + f′ (x0)(x1− x0) = 0.
Solving this equation for x1, we conclude that
f (x0)
x1 = x0−
f′(x0).
Similarly, the point ⎛ ⎝x2, 0⎞ ⎠ is the x -intercept of the tangent line to f at x1. Therefore, x2 satisfies the equation
f (x1)
x2 = x1−
f′(x1).
In general, for n > 0, xn satisfies
f (xn− 1)
(4.8)
xn = xn− 1−
f′(xn− 1).
Next we see how to make use of this technique to approximate the root of the polynomial f (x) = x3
− 3x + 1.

Solution
From Figure 4.78, we see that f has one root over the interval (1, 2). Therefore x0 = 2 seems like
a reasonable first approximation. To find the next approximation, we use Equation 4.8. Since
f (x) = x3
− 3x + 1, thederivative is f′ (x) = 3x2

that displays 10 digits), we obtain

To find the next approximation, x2, we use Equation 4.8with n = 2 and the value of x1 stored on the

Continuing in this way, we obtain the following results:
x1 ≈ 1.666666667
x2 ≈ 1.548611111
x3 ≈ 1.532390162
x4 ≈ 1.532088989
x5 ≈ 1.532088886
x6 ≈ 1.532088886.
We note that we obtained the same value for x5 and x6. Therefore, any subsequent application of Newton’s
method will most likely give the same value for xn.

method could fail to find a root.
Failures of Newton’s Method
Typically,Newton’smethodisusedtofindrootsfairlyquickly.However,thingscangowrong.SomereasonswhyNewton’s
method might fail include the following:
1. Atoneoftheapproximations xn, thederivative f′ iszeroat xn, but f (xn) ≠ 0. Asaresult,thetangentlineof
f at xn does not intersect the x -axis. Therefore, we cannot continue the iterative process.
2. Theapproximations x0, x1, x2 ,… mayapproachadifferentroot.Ifthefunction f hasmorethanoneroot,itis

3. Theapproximationsmayfailtoapproacharootentirely.InExample4.48,weprovideanexampleofafunction
and an initial guess x0 such that the successive approximations never approach a root because the successive
approximations continue to alternate back and forth between two values.

Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 477
Figure 4.80 If the initial guess x0 is too far from the root sought, it may lead
to approximations that approach a different root.

Consequently,thenumbers x0, x1, x2 ,… continuetobouncebackandforthbetween 0 and 1 andneverget
closer to the root of f which is over the interval [−2, −1] (see Figure4.81). Fortunately, if we choose an
initial approximation x0 closer to the actual root, we can avoid this situation.

between 0 and 1 and never approach the root of f.

Other Iterative Processes
As mentioned earlier, Newton’s method is a type of iterative process. We now look at an example of a different type of
iterative process.
Considerafunction F andaninitialnumber x0. Definethesubsequentnumbers xn bytheformula xn = F(xn− 1). This
processisaniterativeprocessthatcreatesalistofnumbers x0, x1, x2 ,…, xn ,…. Thislistofnumbersmayapproacha

numbers x1, x2, x3 ,… approachesafinitenumber x *

x8 = 1
2(7.9375) + 4 = 7.96875
x9 = 1
2(7.96875) + 4 = 7.984375.
From this list, we conjecture that the values xn approach 8.
Figure 4.82 provides a graphical argument that the values approach 8 as n → ∞. Starting at the point

Definition
A function F is anantiderivative of the function f if
F′ (x) = f (x)
for all x in the domain of f.
Consider the function f (x) = 2x. Knowing the power rule of differentiation, we conclude that F(x) = x2 is an

Theorem,weknowthatif F and G aredifferentiablefunctionssuchthat F′ (x) = G′ (x), then F(x) − G(x) = C for
some constant C. This fact leads to the following important theorem.
486 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
Theorem 4.14:General Form of an Antiderivative
Let F be an antiderivative of f over an interval I. Then,
i. for each constant C, the function F(x) + C is also an antiderivative of f over I;
ii. if G is an antiderivative of f over I, there is a constant C for which G(x) = F(x) + C over I.
In other words, the most general form of the antiderivative of f over I is F(x) + C.
We use this fact and our knowledge of derivatives to find all the antiderivatives for several functions.
Example 4.50
Finding Antiderivatives
For each of the following functions, find all antiderivatives.
a. f (x) = 3x2
b. f (x) = 1
x
c. f (x) = cosx
d. f (x) = ex
Solution
a. Because
d
dx
⎛ ⎝x3⎞ ⎠= 3x2
then F(x) = x3 is an antiderivative of 3x2
. Therefore, every antiderivative of 3x2 is of the form
x3 + C for some constant C, and every function of the form x3 + C is an antiderivative of 3x2
.
b. Let f (x) = ln|x|. For x > 0, f (x) = ln(x) and

For x < 0, f (x) = ln(−x) and

Therefore,

Thus, F(x) = ln|x| is an antiderivative of 1
x. Therefore, every antiderivative of 1

ln|x| + C for some constant C and every function of the form ln|x| + C is an antiderivative of 1

if and only if F is an antiderivative of f. Therefore, when claiming that
∫ f (x)dx = F(x) + C
it is important to check whether this statement is correct by verifying that F′ (x) = f (x).

the statement

InTable4.13,welistedtheindefiniteintegralsformanyelementaryfunctions.Let’snowturnourattentiontoevaluating

and G are antiderivatives of any functions f and g, respectively, then
d
dx(F(x) + G(x)) = F′ (x) + G′ (x) = f (x) + g(x).
Therefore, F(x) + G(x) is an antiderivative of f (x) + g(x) and we have
∫⎛ ⎝ f (x) + g(x)⎞ ⎠dx = F(x) + G(x) + C.
Similarly,
∫⎛ ⎝ f (x) − g(x)⎞ ⎠dx = F(x) − G(x) + C.
In addition, consider the task of finding an antiderivative of k f (x), d

where k is any real number. Since
for any real number k, we conclude that

Initial-Value Problems
Welookattechniquesforintegratingalargevarietyoffunctionsinvolvingproducts,quotients,andcompositionslaterin
the text. Here we turn to one common use for antiderivatives that arises often in many applications: solving differential
equations.
Adifferential equation is an equation that relates an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. The equation
dy
dx
(4.9)
= f (x)
is a simple example of a differential equation. Solving this equation means finding a function y with a derivative f.
Therefore,thesolutionsofEquation4.9aretheantiderivativesof f. If F isoneantiderivativeof f, everyfunctionof
the form y = F(x) + C is a solution of that differential equation. For example, the solutions of
dy
dx
= 6x2
are given by
y = ∫ 6x2 dx = 2x3 + C.
Sometimes we are interested in determining whether a particular solution curve passes through a certain point (x0, y0)
—that is, y(x0) = y0. The problem of finding a function y that satisfies a differential equation
dy
(4.10)
= f (x)
dx
with the additional condition
y(x0) = y0
(4.11)
is an example of an initial-value problem. The condition y(x0) = y0 is known as an initial condition. For example,
looking for a function y that satisfies the differential equation
dy
= 6x2
dx
and the initial condition
y(1) = 5
is an example of an initial-value problem. Since the solutions of the differential equation are y = 2x3 + C, to find a
function y thatalsosatisfiestheinitialcondition,weneedtofind C suchthat y(1) = 2(1)3 + C= 5. Fromthisequation,
we see that C= 3, and we conclude that y = 2x3 + 3 is the solution of this initial-value problem as shown in the
following graph.

constant rate of 15 ft/sec2
.
a. How many seconds elapse before the car stops?
b. How far does the car travel during that time?
Solution
a. First we introduce variables for this problem. Let t be the time (in seconds) after the brakes are first
applied.Let a(t) betheaccelerationofthecar(infeetpersecondssquared)attime t. Let v(t) bethe
velocityofthecar(infeetpersecond)attime t. Let s(t) bethecar’sposition(infeet)beyondthepoint
where the brakes are applied at time t.
Thecaristravelingatarateof 88 ft/sec. Therefore,theinitialvelocityis v(0) = 88 ft/sec.Sincethecar
is decelerating, the acceleration is
a(t) = −15 ft/s2
.
The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity,
v′ (t) = −15.
Therefore, we have an initial-value problem to solve:

Integrating, we find that
Since v(0) = 88, C= 88. Thus, the velocity function is
v(t) = −15t + C.
v(t) = −15t + 88.

4.2Linear Approximations and Differentials
• A differentiable function y = f (x) can be approximated at a by the linear function
L(x) = f (a) + f′(a)(x− a).
• For a function y = f (x), if x changes from a to a + dx, then
dy = f′(x)dx
is an approximation for the change in y. The actual change in y is
Δy = f (a + dx) − f (a).
• Ameasurementerror dx canleadtoanerrorinacalculatedquantity f (x). Theerrorinthecalculatedquantityis
known as thepropagated error. The propagated error can be estimated by
dy ≈ f′(x)dx.
• To estimate the relative error of a particular quantity q, we estimate Δq

extremum occurs at a critical point or an endpoint.
4.4The Mean Value Theorem
• If f is continuous over [a, b] and differentiable over (a, b) and f (a) = 0 = f (b), then there exists a point
c ∈ (a, b) such that f′ (c) = 0. This is Rolle’s theorem.
• If f is continuous over [a, b] and differentiable over (a, b), then there exists a point c ∈ (a, b) such that
f′(c) = f (b) − f (a)
b− a.
502 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives
This is the Mean Value Theorem.
• If f′(x) = 0 over an interval I, then f is constant over I.
• Iftwodifferentiablefunctions f and g satisfy f′(x) = g′(x) over I, then f (x) = g(x) + C forsomeconstant
C.
• If f′ (x) > 0 overaninterval I, then f isincreasingover I. If f′(x) < 0 over I, then f isdecreasingover
I.
4.5Derivatives and the Shape of a Graph
• If c isacriticalpointof f and f′ (x) > 0 for x < c and f′ (x) < 0 for x > c, then f hasalocalmaximumat
c.
• If c isacriticalpointof f and f′ (x) < 0 for x < c and f′ (x) > 0 for x > c, then f hasalocalminimumat
c.
• If f″(x) > 0 over an interval I, then f is concave up over I.
• If f″(x) < 0 over an interval I, then f is concave down over I.
• If f′ (c) = 0 and f″(c) > 0, then f has a local minimum at c.
• If f′ (c) = 0 and f″(c) < 0, then f has a local maximum at c.
• If f′ (c) = 0 and f″(c) = 0, thenevaluate f′ (x) atatestpoint x totheleftof c andatestpoint x totheright

4.6Limits at Infinity and Asymptotes
• The limit of f (x) is L as x → ∞ (or as x → −∞) if the values f (x) become arbitrarily close to L as x
becomes sufficiently large.
• Thelimitof f (x) is ∞ as x → ∞ if f (x) becomesarbitrarilylargeas x becomessufficientlylarge.Thelimit
of f (x) is−∞ as x → ∞ if f (x) < 0 and | f (x)| becomesarbitrarilylargeas x becomessufficientlylarge.We
can define the limit of f (x) as x approaches−∞ similarly.
• For a polynomial function p(x) = an xn + an− 1 xn− 1 + … + a1 x + a0, where an ≠ 0, the end behavior is

Sigma (Summation) Notation
Asmentioned,wewilluseshapesofknownareatoapproximatetheareaofanirregularregionboundedbycurves.This
processoftenrequiresaddinguplongstringsofnumbers.Tomakeiteasiertowritedowntheselengthysums,welookat
somenewnotationhere,calledsigma notation (alsoknownassummation notation).TheGreekcapitalletter Σ, sigma,
is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1 to 20
without sigma notation, we have to write
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20.
We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ⋯ + 19 + 20,
which is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation, we write this sum as
20
∑
i= 1
i,
which is much more compact.
Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form
n
∑

where ai describesthetermstobeadded,andthei iscalledtheindex.Eachtermisevaluated,thenwesumallthevalues,

Let’s try a couple of examples of using sigma notation.

On each subinterval [xi− 1, xi] (for i= 1, 2, 3,…, n), construct a rectangle with width Δx and height equal to
f (xi− 1), which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle is

Figure 5.4 In the right-endpoint approximation of area under

[0, 3] into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus, Δx = 0.5. We then form six rectangles by drawing vertical lines
perpendicular to xi− 1, theleft endpoint ofeach subinterval. Wedetermine theheight ofeach rectangle bycalculating
f (xi− 1) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Theintervalsare ⎡ ⎣0, 0.5⎤ ⎦,
⎡ ⎣0.5, 1⎤ ⎦,

If f (x) is continuous on ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦, thenf is integrable on ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦.
Functions that are not continuous on ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦ may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities. For
example, functions with a finite number of jump discontinuities on a closed interval are integrable.

Area and the Definite Integral

Net Signed Area
Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function f (x) = 2 − 2x2 (shown in Figure 5.17) on
the interval [0, 2]. Use n = 8 and choose ⎧
⎩ ⎨xi
* } as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each
subinterval of height f ⎛ ⎝xi
* ⎞ ⎠ and width Δx. When f ⎛ ⎝xi
* ⎞ ⎠ is positive, the product f ⎛ ⎝xi
* ⎞ ⎠Δx represents the area of the
rectangle,asbefore.When f ⎛ ⎝xi
* ⎞ ⎠ isnegative,however,theproduct f ⎛ ⎝xi
* ⎞ ⎠Δx representsthenegative oftheareaofthe
rectangle. The Riemann sum then becomes

∑
f ⎛ ⎝xi

Find the net signed area between the curve of the function f (x) = 2x and thex-axis over the interval [−3, 3].

Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let’s examine another important theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for
Integrals, which is needed to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
TheMean Value Theorem for Integrals statesthatacontinuousfunctiononaclosedintervaltakesonitsaveragevalue

with the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the preceding section.
Theorem 5.3:The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
If f (x) is continuous over an interval ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦, then there is at least one point c ∈ ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦ such that
b
f (c) = 1
b− a∫a
f (x)dx.
(5.15)
This formula can also be stated as
b
∫a
f (x)dx = f (c)(b− a).
Proof
Since f (x) iscontinuouson ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦, bytheextremevaluetheorem(seeMaximaandMinima),itassumesminimumand
maximumvalues—m andM,respectively—on ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦. Then,forallx in ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦, wehave m ≤ f (x) ≤ M. Therefore,by
the comparison theorem (seeThe Definite Integral), we have
b
m(b− a) ≤ ∫a
f (x)dx ≤ M(b− a).
550 Chapter 5 | Integration
Dividing by b− a gives us

m ≤ 1
b− a∫a
f (x)dx ≤ M.
b
Since 1

b
f (c) = 1

and the proof is complete.

Finding the Average Value of a Function
Findtheaveragevalueofthefunction f (x) = 8 − 2x overtheinterval [0, 4] andfindc suchthat f (c) equals
the average value of the function over [0, 4].

The formula states the mean value of f (x) is given by

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Integrals and
Antiderivatives
As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful theorem that establishes the
relationshipbetweendifferentiationandintegration,andgivesusawaytoevaluatedefiniteintegralswithoutusingRiemann
sums or calculating areas. The theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration.
Theorem 5.4:Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1
If f (x) is continuous over an interval ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦, and the function F(x) is defined by
x
F(x) = ∫a

then F′ (x) = f (x) over ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦.

Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a reason it is called the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a relationship between integration and differentiation, but
alsoitguaranteesthatanyintegrablefunctionhasanantiderivative.Specifically,itguaranteesthatanycontinuousfunction
has an antiderivative.

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2: The Evaluation Theorem
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, is perhaps the most important theorem in calculus. After tireless efforts
bymathematiciansforapproximately500years,newtechniquesemergedthatprovidedscientistswiththenecessarytools
to explain many phenomena. Using calculus, astronomers could finally determine distances in space and map planetary
orbits.Everydayfinancialproblemssuchascalculatingmarginalcostsorpredictingtotalprofitcouldnowbehandledwith
simplicity and accuracy. Engineers could calculate the bending strength of materials or the three-dimensional motion of
objects. Our view of the world was forever changed with calculus.
Afterfindingapproximateareasbyaddingtheareasofn rectangles,theapplicationofthistheoremisstraightforwardby
comparison. It almost seems too simple that the area of an entire curved region can be calculated by just evaluating an
antiderivative at the first and last endpoints of an interval.
Theorem 5.5:The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2
Iff is continuous over the interval ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦ and F(x) is any antiderivative of f (x), then
b
∫a
f (x)dx = F(b) − F(a).

function F(x) evaluated at the lower limit (in this case,a).
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 (also known as the evaluation theorem) states that if we can find an

antiderivativefortheintegrand,thenwecanevaluatethedefiniteintegralbyevaluatingtheantiderivativeattheendpoints
of the interval and subtracting.
Proof
Let P = {xi}, i= 0, 1,…, n be a regular partition of ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦. Then, we can write
F(b) − F(a) = F(xn) − F(x0)
= ⎡ ⎣F(xn) − F(xn− 1)⎤ ⎦ + ⎡ ⎣F(xn− 1) − F(xn− 2)⎤ ⎦ + … + ⎡ ⎣F(x1) − F(x0)⎤ ⎦
n
= ∑
i= 1
⎡ ⎣F(xi) − F(xi− 1)⎤ ⎦.
Now,weknowF isanantiderivativeoff over ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦, sobytheMeanValueTheorem(seeTheMeanValueTheorem)
for i= 0, 1,…, n we can find ci in [xi− 1, xi] such that
F(xi) − F(xi− 1) = F′ (ci⎞ ⎠(xi− xi− 1) = f (ci)Δx.
Then, substituting into the previous equation, we have
n
F(b) − F(a) = ∑
i = 1
f (ci)Δx.
Taking the limit of both sides as n → ∞, we obtain
n
F(b) − F(a) = lim

Noticethatwedidnotincludethe“+C”termwhenwewrotetheantiderivative.Thereasonisthat,according
to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, any antiderivative works. So, for convenience, we chose the

Integrating Even and Odd Functions
We saw in Functions and Graphs that an even function is a function in which f (−x) = f (x) for all x in the
domain—that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when x is replaced with −x. The graphs of even functions are
symmetricaboutthey-axis.Anoddfunctionisoneinwhich f (−x) = − f (x) forallx inthedomain,andthegraphofthe
function is symmetric about the origin.
Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from −a to a, involve two equal areas, because they are
symmetricaboutthey-axis.Integralsofoddfunctions,whenthelimitsofintegrationaresimilarly [−a, a], evaluateto
zero because the areas above and below thex-axis are equal.

TheFundamentalTheoremofCalculusgaveusamethodtoevaluateintegralswithoutusingRiemannsums.Thedrawback
of this method, though, is that we must be able to find an antiderivative, and this is not always easy. In this section we
examineatechnique,calledintegration by substitution,tohelpusfindantiderivatives.Specifically,thismethodhelpsus
find antiderivatives when the integrand is the result of a chain-rule derivative.

Theorem 5.7:Substitution with Indefinite Integrals
Let u = g(x), , where g′ (x) iscontinuousoveraninterval,let f (x) becontinuousoverthecorrespondingrangeof
g, and let F(x) be an antiderivative of f (x). Then,
∫ f ⎡ ⎣g(x)⎤ ⎦g′ (x)dx = ∫ f (u)du
= F(u) + C
= F⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ + C.
(5.19)

Letf,g,u, andF be as specified in the theorem. Then
d
F(g(x)) = F′ (g(x)⎞ ⎠g′ (x)
dx
= f ⎡ ⎣g(x)⎤ ⎦g′ (x).
Integrating both sides with respect tox, we see that
If we now substitute u = g(x), and du = g'(x)dx, we get
∫ f ⎡ ⎣g(x)⎤ ⎦g′ (x)dx = F⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ + C.
∫ f ⎡ ⎣g(x)⎤ ⎦g′ (x)dx = ∫ f (u)du
= F(u) + C
= F⎛ ⎝g(x)⎞ ⎠ + C.

Rewrite the integral as ⌠ ⌡ z⎛ ⎝z2

Let u = 1 + 2x3

multiply both sides of theduequation by 1/6. Then,
du = 6x2 dx

The exponential function is perhaps the most efficient function in terms of the operations of calculus. The exponential
function, y = ex
, is its own derivative and its own integral.
Rule: Integrals of Exponential Functions
Exponential functions can be integrated using the following formulas.
∫ex dx = ex + C
∫ax dx = ax
+ C

Example 5.37
Finding an Antiderivative of an Exponential Function
Find the antiderivative of the exponential functione−x
.
Solution
Use substitution, setting u = −x, −du = dx. Then,
and then du = −1dx. Multiply the du equation by −1, so you now have
∫e−xdx = −∫eu du
= −eu + C
= −e−x + C.

A common mistake when dealing with exponential expressions is treating the exponent on e the same way we treat
exponentsinpolynomialexpressions.Wecannotusethepowerrulefortheexponentone.Thiscanbeespeciallyconfusing

Example 5.38
Square Root of an Exponential Function
Find the antiderivative of the exponential function ex Solution
First rewrite the problem using a rational exponent:
1 + ex
.
∫ex 1 + exdx = ∫ex (1 + ex)1/2 dx.
Using substitution, choose u = 1 + ex
.u = 1 + ex
. Then, du = ex dx. We have (Figure 5.37)
∫ex (1 + ex)1/2 dx = ∫u1/2 du.
Then

tubes per week, is given as

.
If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?
Solution
Tofindtheprice–demandequation,integratethemarginalprice–demandfunction.Firstfindtheantiderivative,
then look at the particulars. Thus,
p(x) = ∫ −0.015e−0.01x dx
= −0.015∫e−0.01xdx.
Usingsubstitution,let u = −0.01x and du = −0.01dx. Then,dividebothsidesofthedu equationby−0.01.
This gives

−0.01 ∫eu du = 1.5∫eu du

ThenextstepistosolveforC.Weknowthatwhenthepriceis$2.35pertube,thedemandis50tubesperweek.
This means
598 Chapter 5 | Integration
p(50) = 1.5e
−0.01(50) + C
= 2.35.
Now, just solve forC:
C= 2.35 − 1.5e−0.5
= 2.35 − 0.91
= 1.44.
Thus,
p(x) = 1.5e−0.01x + 1.44.
If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price would be
p(100) = 1.5e
−0.01(100) + 1.44 = 1.5e−1 + 1.44 ≈ 1.99.
The supermarket should charge $1.99 per tube if it is selling 100 tubes per week.

Again, substitution is the method to use. Let u = 1 − x, so du = −1dx or−du = dx. Then
∫e1 − x dx = −∫eu du. Next, change the limits of integration. Using the equation u = 1 − x, we have
u = 1 − (1) = 0

We have

Then, at t = 0 we have Q(0) = 10 = 1

At time t = 2, we have

Finding an Antiderivative Involving the Inverse Tangent Function
Find an antiderivative of ⌠ ⌡

1 + 4x2dx.
Solution
Comparing this problem with the formulas stated in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse
trigonometric functions, the integrand looks similar to the formula for tan−1 u + C. So we use substitution,
letting u = 2x, then du = 2dx and 1/2du = dx. Then, we have

As we did before, we are going to partition the interval on the x-axis and approximate the area between the graphs
of the functions with rectangles. So, for i = 0, 1, 2,…, n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦. Then, for
i = 1, 2,…, n, choose a point xi
* ∈ [xi− 1, xi], and on each interval [xi− 1, xi] construct a rectangle that extends
verticallyfrom g(xi

The technique we have just described is called theslicing method. To apply it, we use the following strategy.
Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding Volumes by the Slicing Method
1. Examinethesolidanddeterminetheshapeofacross-sectionofthesolid.Itisoftenhelpfultodrawapicture
if one is not provided.
2. Determine a formula for the area of the cross-section.
3. Integrate the area formula over the appropriate interval to get the volume.
Recallthatinthissection,weassumetheslicesareperpendiculartothe x-axis. Therefore,theareaformulaisintermsof
x andthelimitsofintegrationlieonthe x-axis. However,theproblem-solvingstrategyshownhereisvalidregardlessof
how we choose to slice the solid.

The Method of Cylindrical Shells
Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a region R, bounded above by the graph of a
function y = f (x), belowbythe x-axis, andontheleftandrightbythelines x = a and x = b, respectively,asshown
inFigure6.25(a).Wethenrevolvethisregionaroundthey-axis,asshowninFigure6.25(b).Notethatthisisdifferent

Thus, the cross-sectional area is πxi

Vshell ≈ 2π f (xi

Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate
(Figure 6.28).
Figure 6.28 (a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up to form a flat plate.

plate. Multiplying the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get
Vshell ≈ f (xi

which is the same formula we had before.
To calculate the volume of the entire solid, we then add the volumes of all the shells and obtain
n
V ≈ ∑
i= 1
⎛ ⎝2πxi

Here we have another Riemann sum, this time for the function 2πx f (x). Taking the limit as n → ∞ gives us

Arc Length of the Curvey =f(x)
Inpreviousapplicationsofintegration,werequiredthefunction f (x) tobeintegrable,oratmostcontinuous.However,
forcalculatingarclengthwehaveamorestringentrequirementfor f (x). Here,werequire f (x) tobedifferentiable,and
furthermorewerequireitsderivative, f′(x), tobecontinuous.Functionslikethis,whichhavecontinuousderivatives,are
calledsmooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.)
Let f (x) beasmoothfunctiondefinedover ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦. Wewanttocalculatethelengthofthecurvefromthepoint ⎛ ⎝a, f (a)⎞ ⎠
to the point ⎛ ⎝b, f (b)⎞ ⎠. We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve. For i = 0, 1, 2,…, n,
let P = {xi} be a regular partition of ⎡ ⎣a, b⎤ ⎦. Then, for i = 1, 2,…, n, construct a line segment from the point
⎛ ⎝xi− 1, f (xi− 1)⎞ ⎠ tothepoint ⎛ ⎝xi, f (xi)⎞ ⎠. Althoughitmightseemlogicaltouseeitherhorizontalorverticallinesegments,
we want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible.Figure 6.37depicts this construct for n = 5.

We state this result in the following theorem.
Theorem 6.7:Mass–Density Formula of a One-Dimensional Object

the density of the rod at a pointx in the interval. Then the mass of the rod is given by
b

ρ(x)dx.
(6.10)
We apply this theorem in the next example.
Example 6.23
Calculating Mass from Linear Density
Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval [π/2, π]. If the density of the rod is given by
ρ(x) = sin x, what is the mass of the rod?
Solution
ApplyingEquation 6.10directly, we have

ρ(x) = 2x2 + 3, Considerathinrodorientedonthex-axisovertheinterval [1, 3]. Ifthedensityoftherodisgivenby
what is the mass of the rod?
We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius r. As with the rod we looked at in
the one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a
two-dimensionalobject.Weassumethedensityisgivenintermsofmassperunitarea(calledarea density),andfurther
assume the density varies only along the disk’s radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the xy-plane, with
the center at the origin. Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of x, denoted ρ(x). We assume
ρ(x) is integrable. Because density is a function of x, we partition the interval from [0, r] along the x-axis. For
i = 0, 1, 2,…, n, let P = {xi} bearegularpartitionoftheinterval [0, r], andfor i = 1, 2,…, n, chooseanarbitrary
point xi
* ∈ [xi− 1, xi]. Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-dimensional) washers. A disk and a
representative washer are depicted in the following figure.

Using ρ(xi

When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to
compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or
stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.

point xi
* ∈ [xi− 1, xi]. To calculate the work done to move an object from point xi− 1 to point xi, we assume the
force is roughly constant over the interval, and use F(xi

[xi− 1, xi], then, is given by
Wi ≈ F(xi

According to Hooke’s law, the force required to compress or stretch a spring from an equilibrium position is given by

Solution
First find the spring constant, k. When x = −0.2, we know F(x) = −10, so
F(x) = kx

Center of Mass and Moments
Let’sbeginbylookingatthecenterofmassinaone-dimensionalcontext.Consideralong,thinwireorrodofnegligible
mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure6.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses m1 and m2 at
distances d1 and d2 from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown inFigure 6.62(b).

Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if m1 d1 = m2 d2.
In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However,
we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by
movingthefulcrum.Supposewehavetwopointmasses, m1 and m2, locatedonanumberlineatpoints x1 and x2,

Finding the Center of Mass of Objects along a Line
Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows:

m1 = 30 kg, placed at x1 = −2 m m3 = 10 kg, placed at x3 = 6 m m2 = 5 kg, placed at x2 = 3 m
m4 = 15 kg, placed at x4 = −3 m.
Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system.
Solution
First, we need to calculate the moment of the system:
4
M = ∑
mixi
i= 1
= −60 + 15 + 60 − 45 = −30.
Now, to find the center of mass, we need the total mass of the system:

Then we have

The center of mass is located 1/2 m to the left of the origin.

Suppose four point masses are placed on a number line as follows:
m1 = 12 kg, placed at x1 = −4 m m2 = 12 kg, placed at x2 = 4 m
m3 = 30 kg, placed at x3 = 2 m m4 = 6 kg, placed at x4 = −6 m.
Find the moment of the system with respect to the origin and find the center of mass of the system.
We can generalize this concept to find the center of mass of a system of point masses in a plane. Let m1 be a point
mass located at point (x1, y1) in the plane. Then the moment Mx of the mass with respect to the x-axis is given by
Mx = m1 y1. Similarly,themoment My withrespecttothey-axisisgivenby My = m1 x1. Noticethatthex-coordinate

Find the center of mass of the system.

The following figure shows the graphs of exp x and ln x.

We hypothesize that exp x = ex

ln(ex) = x ln e = x. Thus, when x is rational, ex
= exp x. For irrational values of x, we simply define ex as the
inverse function of ln x.

General Logarithmic and Exponential Functions
Weclosethissectionbylookingatexponentialfunctionsandlogarithmswithbasesotherthan e. Exponentialfunctions
arefunctionsoftheform f (x) = ax
. Notethatunless a = e, westilldonothaveamathematicallyrigorousdefinition
of these functions for irrational exponents. Let’s rectify that here by defining the function f (x) = ax in terms of the
exponential function ex
. We then examine logarithms with bases other than e as inverse functions of exponential
functions.
Definition
For any a > 0, and for any real number x, define y = ax as follows:
y = ax
= ex ln a
.
Now ax isdefinedrigorouslyforallvaluesofx.Thisdefinitionalsoallowsustogeneralizepropertyiv.oflogarithmsand

properties of exponents hold for general exponential functions defined in this way.
Let’s now apply this definition to calculate a differentiation formula for ax
. We have
d

ax

ex ln a

The corresponding integration formula follows immediately.
Theorem 6.20:Derivatives and Integrals Involving General Exponential Functions
Let a > 0. Then,
d

dx
and
∫ax dx = 1
ax + C.
ln a
If a ≠ 1, then the function ax is one-to-one and has a well-defined inverse. Its inverse is denoted by loga x. Then,
y = loga x if and only if x = ay
.
Note that general logarithm functions can be written in terms of the natural logarithm. Let y = loga x. Then, x = ay
.
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides of this second equation, we get
ln x = ln(ay)
ln x = y ln a
y = ln x
ln a
log x = ln x
ln a.
Thus, we see that all logarithmic functions are constant multiples of one another. Next, we use this formula to find a
differentiation formula for a logarithm with base a. Again, let y = loga x. Then,

That is, the rate of growth is proportional to the current function value. This is a key feature of exponential growth.
Equation6.27involves derivatives and is called a differential equation. We learn more about differential equations in

modeling.
Example 6.42
Population Growth
Consider the population of bacteria described earlier. This population grows according to the function
f (t) = 200e0.02t
, where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 5
hours (300 minutes)? When does the population reach 100,000 bacteria?
Solution
We have f (t) = 200e0.02t
. Then
f (300) = 200e
0.02(300) ≈ 80,686.
There are 80,686 bacteria in the population after 5 hours.
To find when the population reaches 100,000 bacteria, we solve the equation
100,000 = 200e0.02t
500 = e0.02t
ln 500 = 0.02t
t = ln 500
0.02 ≈ 310.73.

Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period. Therefore, if the bank

Solution
We know it takes the population of fish 6 months to double in size. So, if t represents time in months,

y = 500e
. To figure out when the population reaches 10,000 fish, we must solve the following

The following figure shows a graph of a representative exponential decay function.
Figure 6.80 An example of exponential decay.
Let’s look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton’s law of cooling says that an object cools at a rate
proportionaltothedifferencebetweenthetemperatureoftheobjectandthetemperatureofthesurroundings.Inotherwords,
if T represents the temperature of the object and Ta represents the ambient temperature in a room, then
T′
= −k(T− Ta).
Notethatthisisnotquitetherightmodelforexponentialdecay.Wewantthederivativetobeproportionaltothefunction,
andthisexpressionhastheadditional Ta term.Fortunately,wecanmakeachangeofvariablesthatresolvesthisissue.Let
y(t) = T(t) − Ta. Then y′(t) = T′(t) − 0 = T′(t), and our equation becomes
y′
= −ky.
From our previous work, we know this relationship betweeny and its derivative leads to exponential decay. Thus,
y = y0 e−kt
,
and we see that
T− Ta = ⎛ ⎝T0− Ta
⎞ ⎠e−kt
T = ⎛ ⎝T0− Ta
⎞ ⎠e−kt + Ta
where T0 represents the initial temperature. Let’s apply this formula in the following example.

According to experienced baristas, the optimal temperature to serve coffee is between 155°F and 175°F.

Table 6.2Derivatives of the
Hyperbolic Functions
Let’s take a moment to compare the derivatives of the hyperbolic functions with the derivatives of the standard
trigonometric functions. There are a lot of similarities, but differences as well. For example, the derivatives of the sine
functionsmatch: (d/dx)sin x = cos x and (d/dx)sinh x = cosh x. Thederivativesofthecosinefunctions,however,differ
insign: (d/dx)cos x = −sin x, but (d/dx)cosh x = sinh x. Aswecontinueourexaminationofthehyperbolicfunctions,
we must be mindful of their similarities and differences to the standard trigonometric functions.
These differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions lead directly to the following integral formulas.
∫ sinh u du = cosh u + C ∫csch2 u du = −coth u + C
∫ cosh u du = sinh u + C ∫sech u tanh u du = −sech u + C

KEY CONCEPTS
6.1Areas between Curves
• Justasdefiniteintegralscanbeusedtofindtheareaunderacurve,theycanalsobeusedtofindtheareabetween
two curves.
• To find the area between two curves defined by functions, integrate the difference of the functions.
• If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex, use the absolute value of the difference of the
functions.Inthiscase,itmaybenecessarytoevaluatetwoormoreintegralsandaddtheresultstofindtheareaof
the region.
• Sometimesitcanbeeasiertointegratewithrespecttoy tofindthearea.Theprinciplesarethesameregardlessof
which variable is used as the variable of integration.
6.2Determining Volumes by Slicing
• Definite integrals can be used to find the volumes of solids. Using the slicing method, we can find a volume by
integrating the cross-sectional area.
• Forsolidsofrevolution,thevolumeslicesareoftendisksandthecross-sectionsarecircles.Themethodofdisks
involvesapplyingthemethodofslicingintheparticularcaseinwhichthecross-sectionsarecircles,andusingthe
formula for the area of a circle.
• Ifasolidofrevolutionhasacavityinthecenter,thevolumeslicesarewashers.Withthemethodofwashers,the
area of the inner circle is subtracted from the area of the outer circle before integrating.

6.4Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area
• The arc length of a curve can be calculated using a definite integral.
• Thearclengthisfirstapproximatedusinglinesegments,whichgeneratesaRiemannsum.Takingalimitthengives
us the definite integral formula. The same process can be applied to functions of y.
• The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a surface of revolution.
• Theintegralsgeneratedbyboththearclengthandsurfaceareaformulasareoftendifficulttoevaluate.Itmaybe
necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of the integrals.
6.5Physical Applications
• Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics.
• Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known.
• Workcanalsobecalculatedfromintegratingaforcefunction,orwhencounteractingtheforceofgravity,asina
pumping problem.
• Definite integrals can also be used to calculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a liquid.
6.6Moments and Centers of Mass
• Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be
concentratedwithoutchangingthemoment.Looselyspeaking,thecenterofmasscanbethoughtofasthebalancing
point of the system.
• For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is

M = ∑
mi xi. For point masses distributed in a plane, the moments of the system with respect to the x- and
i = 1
y-axes, respectively, are Mx = ∑

thex-axis,respectively,bythetotalmass.Thesymmetryprinciplesaysthatifaregionissymmetricwithrespectto
a line, then the centroid of the region lies on the line.
• The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis, the volume of the
resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance traveled by the centroid of the region.
6.7Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms
• Theearliertreatmentoflogarithmsandexponentialfunctionsdidnotdefinethefunctionspreciselyandformally.
This section develops the concepts in a mathematically rigorous way.
• The cornerstone of the development is the definition of the natural logarithm in terms of an integral.
• The function ex is then defined as the inverse of the natural logarithm.
• General exponential functions are defined in terms of ex
, and the corresponding inverse functions are general
logarithms.
760 Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration
• Familiar properties of logarithms and exponents still hold in this more rigorous context.
6.8Exponential Growth and Decay
• Exponential growth and exponential decay are two of the most common applications of exponential functions.
• Systems that exhibit exponential growth follow a model of the form y = y0 ekt
.
• In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present. In other words, y′
= ky.
• Systems that exhibit exponential growth have a constant doubling time, which is given by (ln 2)/k.
• Systems that exhibit exponential decay follow a model of the form y = y0 e−kt
.
• Systems that exhibit exponential decay have a constant half-life, which is given by (ln 2)/k.
6.9Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions
• Hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions.
• Term-by-term differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. These differentiation
formulas give rise, in turn, to integration formulas.
• With appropriate range restrictions, the hyperbolic functions all have inverses.
• Implicitdifferentiationyieldsdifferentiationformulasfortheinversehyperbolicfunctions,whichinturngiverise
to integration formulas.
• The most common physical applications of hyperbolic functions are calculations involving catenaries.
